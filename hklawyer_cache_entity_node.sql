Richard Carden, Partner, McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff LLP<p>\n	S. Richard Carden reviews the specific policies of Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Australia and Japan and provides tips on how to address data privacy issues in cross-border litigation.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" height=\"374\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Oct2014/Data-Protection_opt.jpeg\" width=\"538\" /></p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"/en/article.asp?articleid=2354&amp;c=97\">Part I of this article</a> addressed basic concepts of data privacy as set out in the policies of numerous regional and multilateral organisations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (&ldquo;OECD&rdquo;), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (&ldquo;APEC&rdquo;), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (&ldquo;ASEAN&rdquo;). Part II addresses the specific policies of several Asia-Pacific nations and provides a general framework for addressing data privacy issues throughout the litigation process.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Hong Kong</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Hong Kong&rsquo;s data privacy regime is governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) of 1996, as most recently amended in 2012 (the &ldquo;PDO&rdquo;). While providing a relatively broad definition of personal information, the PDO does place some reasonable limitations on what constitutes personal information. Specifically s. 2 defines personal data as any data (1) related to a living individual, (2) that allows the identity of the individual to be ascertained, (3) &ldquo;in a form in which access to or processing of the data is practicable.&rdquo; Schedule 1 to the PDO sets forth six guiding principles that are largely consistent with the OECD Guidelines, including requirements for accuracy and security of personal information, limits on the purposes and manners of collection and use of information, and requirements for access to information.</p>\n<p>\n	The PDO provides specific exemptions for uses of personal data in legal proceedings (s. 60B) and for the performance of the judicial function (s. 51A). Thus, the PDO should have little impact on litigation within Hong Kong. However, cross-border transfer of personal information for purposes of overseas litigation is subject to more stringent protections. Section 33 of the PDO details the prohibitions on transfer of personal data outside of Hong Kong, where the personal data is either collected or processed in Hong Kong or is in the control of an entity with a principal place of business in Hong Kong. For purposes of this section, an entity has a principal place of business in Hong Kong if it is incorporated in Hong Kong. Thus, foreign entities with separately incorporated Hong Kong entities may be subjected to the cross-border transfer provisions of s. 33. There are a number of limitations detailed in s. 33, including the specific consent of the data subject; several address the situation where the receiving entity is subject to laws that would provide similar protections to those available in Hong Kong. Whether or not the US would meet this qualification today is an open question, given the recent NSA scandal. Indeed, the EU ended the safe harbor program and has revisited its data privacy laws specifically in view of this scandal.</p>\n<p>\n	Unfortunately, however, US courts may pay little attention to the PDO when the Hong Kong entity is controlled by the US entity. On 31 July 2014, a federal judge in New York upheld a magistrate judge&rsquo;s ruling requiring Microsoft to turn over e-mails maintained in Ireland pursuant to a warrant issued by a US court (see In re Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., F.Supp.2d, 2014 WL 1661004 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)). While discussion in the case was limited primarily to whether US warrants could have extraterritorial effect, there was also a suggestion that a US court could require production even when a foreign nation&rsquo;s privacy laws would otherwise preclude production. This places a company in the unenviable position of either subjecting itself to sanctions from the US court or potentially incurring both monetary and criminal penalties for violations of privacy laws. And under s. 64 of the PDO, there are substantial penalties (HK$1,000,000 fine and 5 years in prison).</p>\n<p>\n	For an in-depth analysis of all provisions of the PDO, visit <a href=\"http://www.pcpd.org.hk\">www.pcpd.org.hk</a>.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>China</strong></p>\n<p>\n	China does not presently have an omnibus data protection regime, however, there are a number of existing laws and proposals that address data privacy. For some years, China has been pursuing implementation of a more formal policy, but has yet to fully implement it.</p>\n<p>\n	In 2013, however, a non-binding standard for the protection of personal information was implemented. The Information Security Technology Guidelines for Personal Information Protection on Public and Commercial Services Information System (the &ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo;) define &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; as &ldquo;[c]omputer data that is handled in computer systems, that are related to a specific natural person, and that can be used independently or in combination with other information to distinguish that specific natural person.&rdquo; (the Guidelines Art. 3.2). The Guidelines distinguish between &ldquo;common&rdquo; personal information and &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; personal information, the disclosure of which &ldquo;may bring about harmful influence to the subject of the indicated personal information.&rdquo; (Id. at Arts. 3.7&ndash;3.8). Article 4.2 of the Guidelines sets out eight governing principles, which are similar in concept and scope to the OECD principles.</p>\n<p>\n	Transfers of personal information under the Guidelines are primarily subject to the consent of the data subject. Perhaps of most significance to overseas litigation is the stringent limitation of Art. 5.4.5 related to transfers to foreign entities:</p>\n<p>\n	<em>Without explicit consent by the subject of personal information, or clear provisions in laws or regulations, or without the agreement of the controlling departments, personal information administrators may not transmit personal information to foreign personal information receivers, including individuals abroad or foreign-registered organisations and institutions.</em></p>\n<p>\n	Notice and consent are also requirements for the collection and processing of personal information under the Guidelines (Id. at Arts. 5.2.3, 5.3.4).</p>\n<p>\n	Notwithstanding the lack of overarching guidelines, China has actively enforced privacy rights. In August 2014, China convicted two British citizens for illegal collection of private data. These individuals had established companies in China and Hong Kong for the purposes of investigating Chinese companies on behalf of the Chinese subsidiaries of multinational corporations. The companies purchased and resold private data related to Chinese citizens. Both were given a prison term and a substantial fine.</p>\n<p>\n	Given the breadth of the Guidelines, there are potentially substantial hurdles involved when parties are seeking discovery from a Chinese entity, or conducting due diligence regarding a Chinese entity.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Singapore</strong></p>\n<p>\n	In 2012, Singapore enacted the Personal Data Protection Act (No. 26 of 2012) (&ldquo;PDPA&rdquo;), which is supplemented by a variety of additional associated regulations and notifications. Singapore&rsquo;s definition of personal data is substantially broader than Hong Kong&rsquo;s and applies to all data that can lead to the identification of an individual, either by itself or in conjunction with other data to which a data user has access (PDPA, Part I, Section 2).</p>\n<p>\n	Several Schedules attached to the PDPA provide exceptions where an organisation can collect, process and use information without the consent of the individual. While these schedules do not specifically state that any use in court proceedings is allowable, there are provisions related to the collection, processing and use of personal data for the provision of legal services. Thus, presumably there are few issues with the PDPA in the context of litigation in Singapore.</p>\n<p>\n	Section 26 of the PDPA, however, limits cross-border transfers of personal data to those areas that offer equivalent protection as is available under the PDPA. The Personal Data Protection Commission (&ldquo;PDPC&rdquo;) may grant exemptions to the limitations. Cross-border transfer restrictions are further delineated in Part III of the Personal Data Protection Regulation of 2014, but still require equivalent protections.</p>\n<p>\n	As with other nations, Singapore provides for both monetary penalties and imprisonment for violations of the Act, up to S$100,000 and 12 months imprisonment per offence (s. 51). Just as with China, Singapore is actively enforcing privacy rights. The PDPC recently launched an investigation of Xiaomi, China&rsquo;s largest mobile provider, for improperly providing mobile user data to telephone marketers. According to the PDPC, if found guilty of violating the PDPA as alleged in the complaint, Xiaomi may face fines up to S$1,000,000.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Australia</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Australia has had a very robust set of data privacy laws for nearly 30 years. In the Privacy Act 1988, Australia, recognising the privacy rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (to which it was a party), and further recognising the efforts of the OECD relating to data privacy, specifically adopted measures to protect personally identifiable information. Just as with the OECD Guidelines, the Australian privacy laws seek to balance the need for legitimate transfers of information between organisations and across borders with the privacy interests of individuals. On 12 March 2014, Australia&rsquo;s existing National Privacy Principles (&ldquo;NPPs&rdquo;) (applicable to private sector entities) and Information Privacy Principles (&ldquo;IPPs&rdquo;) (applicable to government entities) were replaced with a new set of 13 Australian Privacy Principles (&ldquo;APPs&rdquo;). In addition, a new Privacy Regulation went into effect. The APPs mirror in large measure the eight original OECD Guideline principles, although they provide a greater degree of granularity, acknowledging modern day considerations.</p>\n<p>\n	Consistent with many other nations, the Privacy Act provides a broad definition of personal information that encompasses any information about an identified or identifiable individual. However, the Privacy Act contains a potentially problematic twist in that it also covers information that is not &ldquo;recorded in a material form.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n	Among the changes embodied in the APPs are changes to the provisions for cross border transfers of personal information. Just as with other Asia-Pacific nations, APP 8.1 requires that prior to a cross-border transfer, the transferring party must &ldquo;take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the [APPs] (other than [APP] 1) in relation to the information.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n	Australia&rsquo;s approach is similar to the European Union (&ldquo;EU&rdquo;) safe harbor program, and will likely be subject to the same concerns recently expressed by the EU when, ironically enough on12 March 2014, it suspended the safe harbor program in view of the National Security Agency scandal.</p>\n<p>\n	The Australian Privacy Commissioner has investigated numerous data breaches of varying size in the past year, including breaches related to the personal information of detained immigrants, police data regarding ongoing investigations, and [several private company data breaches. In one instance a telecommunications company was fined for allowing personal data related to its customers to be found through simple online searches.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Japan</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Japan has an established data protection framework, implemented in 2003 through the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003) (&ldquo;APPI&rdquo;). As with other data protection laws, the APPI seeks to balance the need for legitimate transfers of information against individual rights.</p>\n<p>\n	Article 2(1) of the APPI defines &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; as &ldquo;information about a living individual which can identify the specific individual by name, date of birth or other description contained in such information (including such information as will allow easy reference to other information and will thereby enable the identification of the specific individual).&rdquo; Article 23 of the APPI limits transfer without consent of data subject or legal authority, similar to the Chinese Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n	Enforcement efforts in Japan are also on the rise. In July, for example, authorities arrested a man for misappropriating and selling personal information related to over 20 million customers of an education services firm. The breach has led to calls for Japan to further strengthen its data protection laws.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Implications for Litigation Involving Entities Outside the United States</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Given the breadth of the definitions of personal information, and the strong interest among the Asia-Pacific nations in ensuring that the balance between disclosure and protection is properly enforced, much of the data sought in modern patent litigation is potentially subject to data protection laws and restrictions on cross-border transfer. Particularly in view of the fact that litigation now often involves terabytes of data (much of which is of marginal or little actual relevance or use), the potential for disclosure of personal data is high. And given the ever increasing penalties implemented or under consideration for breaches of privacy laws, parties to litigation would be well-advised to address these issues head on, rather than waiting for them to be brought up in a discovery motion or a sanctions motion.</p>\n<p>\n	In order to properly assess the impact of data privacy issues on litigation in the US, one must consider how they arise in various stages of litigation, as presumptions of privacy differ markedly throughout the process. During the discovery phase, there is no presumption that the public can or should have access to materials exchanged between the parties, or in materials obtained from non-parties. However, once information is introduced into the courtroom, whether in motion practice, hearings, or at trial, the presumption shifts. At this point, there is an overriding interest in providing the public access to the courts. It is therefore important for the parties to consider what data will be needed at each stage in order to appropriately afford the greatest degree of protection to personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n	The parties should address data privacy issues well before discovery actually begins. There are a number of potential options for limiting the unnecessary disclosure of personal information, and many can actually provide benefits to the parties through a reduction in the overall amount of information collected and reviewed and through a reduction of costs associated with collection, production, and review. Most parties will look primarily to the protective order as a mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of data. However, a protective order in and of itself may not be fully sufficient, particularly once the data is needed for use in an open proceeding. Moreover, given the volume of information associated with modern patent litigation, redaction of personal information is often completely impractical. The parties should instead seek to address these issues as part of a discovery plan.</p>\n<p>\n	As an initial matter, each party should attempt to identify the information it will likely need to produce that may contain personally-identifiable information. Each party should also consider what information it intends to seek that may be subject to privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions, and whether the benefits of the discovery outweigh any potential individual privacy concerns. The parties can then reasonably discuss methods for limiting the amount of information exchanged that may raise privacy concerns. For example, the parties may consider staged discovery such that the earlier stages involve a much more limited set of information, and then expand that discovery if and when it becomes necessary.</p>\n<p>\n	Companies involved in patent litigation may also consider some proactive measures to deal with privacy concerns. For instance, to the extent that there is any reasonable expectation of privacy on behalf of an employee that has not already been contractually addressed, a company may consider providing a specific notice of potential disclosure when implementing legal holds. Of course, given the variety of potentially applicable laws, any notice methods should be drafted in view of the controlling laws in the collection jurisdiction so as to avoid arguments of ineffective notice.</p>\n<p>\n	The parties should also specifically address potential disclosure issues for discovery that will likely be used in open court. Can personal information be appropriately redacted or anonymised? Or must the parties provide notice to the data subject and allow an opportunity for them to oppose disclosure?</p>\n<p>\n	At the end of the day, there are many considerations the parties to litigation must address with respect to the increasing number of data privacy laws worldwide. However, proper advance planning will substantially limit the number of issues that will actually arise, and also potentially provide the parties with a more streamlined and cost-effective discovery process.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Oct2014/Data-security-22_opt.jpeg\" width=\"538\" /></p>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:79:\"Written by S.

Richard Carden reviews the specific policies of Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Australia and Japan and provides tips on how to address data privacy issues in cross-border litigation.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" height=\"374\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Oct2014/Data-Protection_opt.jpeg\" width=\"538\" /></p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"/en/article.asp?articleid=2354&amp;c=97\">Part I of this article</a> addressed basic concepts of data privacy as set out in the policies of numerous regional and multilateral organisations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”). Part II addresses the specific policies of several Asia-Pacific nations and provides a general framework for addressing data privacy issues throughout the litigation process.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Hong Kong</strong></p>\n<p>\n	Hong Kong’s data privacy regime is governed by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) of 1996, as most recently amended in 2012 (the “PDO”). While providing a relatively broad definition of personal information, the PDO does place some reasonable limitations on what constitutes personal information. Specifically s. 2 defines personal data as any data (1) related to a living individual, (2) that allows the identity of the individual to be ascertained, (3) “in a form in which access to or processing of the data is practicable.” Schedule 1 to the PDO sets forth six guiding principles that are largely consistent with the OECD Guidelines, including requirements for accuracy and security of personal information, limits on the purposes and manners of collection and use of information, and requirements for access to information.</p>\n<p>\n	The PDO provides specific exemptions for uses of personal data in legal proceedings (s. 60B) and for the performance of the judicial function (s. 51A). Thus, the PDO should have little impact on litigation within Hong Kong. However, cross-border transfer of personal information for purposes of overseas litigation is subject to more stringent protections. Section 33 of the PDO details the prohibitions on transfer of personal data outside of Hong Kong, where the personal data is either collected or processed in Hong Kong or is in the control of an entity with a principal place of business in Hong Kong. For purposes of this section, an entity has a principal place of business in Hong Kong if it is incorporated in Hong Kong. Thus, foreign entities with separately incorporated Hong Kong entities may be subjected to the cross-border transfer provisions of s. 33. There are a number of limitations detailed in s. 33, including the specific consent of the data subject; several address the situation where the receiving entity is subject to laws that would provide similar protections to those available in Hong Kong. Whether or not the US would meet this qualification today is an open question, given the recent NSA scandal. Indeed, the EU ended the safe harbor program and has revisited its data privacy laws specifically in view of this scandal.</p>\n<p>\n	Unfortunately, however, US courts may pay little attention to the PDO when the Hong Kong entity is controlled by the US entity.

The announcement was accurate at the time and had been legitimately published. However, as the debt had been resolved, the information became irrelevant and misleading. The ECJ thus ruled in favour of the complainant and required Google to remove or conceal the information so that it no longer appears in search results based on his name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The European Commission’s Data Protection Reform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put things in context, we should note that the “right to be forgotten” is a component of the European Commission’s data protection reform proposals formulated to ensure more effective control of people over their personal data, and to make it easier for businesses to operate and innovate in the European Union (“EU”) market. The proposals were endorsed by the European Parliament on 12 March 2014. They have yet to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECJ ruling is therefore to some degree an affirmation of the “right to be forgotten” before it is transposed into national laws. The rationale behind this right is that citizens should be empowered to control their own identity online. If an individual no longer wants his or her personal data to be processed or stored by a data controller (the EU equivalent of “data user” in Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (the “Ordinance”)), and if there is no legitimate reason for keeping it, the data should be removed from their system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Opposition Against the Right</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the test adopted by the ECJ to invoke this right is whether the personal data is “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive” in relation to the original purpose for which the data was collected or processed, and in the light of the time that has elapsed since the original publication. The court decision recognises that the universal diffusion and accessibility of such controverted information by search engines has a disproportionate impact on privacy. It has since generated much controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google, which has since the ECJ decision received more than 190,000 requests to remove links to personal information on its search engine, called the court decision “disappointing”. Not surprisingly, many advocates for freedom of information have spoken against the verdict. Some of them expressed worries that the “right to be forgotten” could spell the end to a <em>free Internet</em>. There were also fears that the exercise of the right would hinder free speech, or inhibit the right to access information. In many ways, these reactions are overblown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not Erasing History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the scope of the exercise of the “right to be forgotten” is narrow. It involves the de-listing of search results for only searches performed on the basis of the person’s name, eg, “John Smith”. If a search is performed based on other search terms (for example, “car accident in London” in which John Smith was involved), the information, inclusive of the person’s name, will not be de-listed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “right to be forgotten”, though a convenient label, is a misnomer as no published material is required to be deleted through exercise of the right. It empowers individuals to control the online dissemination of information about them and involves the de-listing of Internet search results only. The original information continues to exist at the source and can be accessed online directly or by search using other search terms. The public record of a newspaper perpetuates regardless of the removal of the link to it from a search website. Hence any assertion that the exercise of the right will erase past events or rewrite history is misguided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No Absolute “Right to be Forgotten”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, the right is not meant to take precedence over freedom of expression or freedom of the media. There is no absolute right to have links removed. Each removal request has to be determined on its merits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In late November 2014, a working party comprising EU data protection authorities released a set of guidelines (the “Guidelines”) on how the “right to be forgotten” is to be implemented in Europe. They recognised that a balance of the relevant rights and interests has to be made and the outcome may depend on the nature and sensitivity of the personal data in question and on the interest of the public in having access to that particular information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guidelines articulated 13 criteria<sup>2</sup> which need to be considered when deciding whether a request to de-list information should be accepted. They include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>whether the person plays a role in public life (for example, being a politician, senior public official or member of the [regulated] profession), and whether public access to that information will protect them against his public or professional improper conduct (for example, malpractice litigation against a doctor, dishonest behaviour of a politician or businessman are unlikely to be de-listed);</li>\r\n	<li>whether the information relates to the exercise of a public figure’s official functions rather than genuinely private information such as information about their health or family members (if affirmative, there will be a strong argument against de-listing); and</li>\r\n	<li>whether the information is sensitive (for example, information about a person’s health, sexuality or religious belief) and thus has a greater impact on the data subject’s private life (if affirmative, de-listing requests should be favourably considered).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on these criteria, it should be obvious that contrary to the assertions of many critics, the “right to be forgotten” will not allow public figures to “whitewash” their unflattering personal titbits. Nor will it allow professionals or public officials who owe a duty to the public to cover up their past misconduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Applicability of the ECJ Ruling to Hong Kong?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ECJ ruling, of course, does not bind Hong Kong courts. <em>Prima facie</em>, the approach it has taken is not applicable under the Ordinance. In the landmark case of <em>Eastweek</em><sup>3</sup>, the judgment of the Court of Appeal pointed out that “It is … of the essence of the required act of personal data collection that the data user must thereby be compiling information about an identified person or about a person whom the data user intends or seeks to identify.” As such, Google is not a data user as it does not collect personal data in this manner. Rather, it acts as an intermediary that only provides a facility for web users to gather information dispersed in various websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Google entertains requests to remove links from only nationals of EU-countries and four other non-EU-countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Territorial Effect of a De-Listing Decision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitherto, Google has responded to justifiable de-listing requests by removing search results from all its European websites but not its google.com site. Hence anyone using the google.com version of the search engine will be able to circumvent the ECJ ruling and see the complete search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address this anomaly, the EU data protection authorities have stated in the Guidelines that de-listing decisions must be implemented by search engines in such a way that they guarantee the effective and complete protection of data subjects’ rights. In practice, this means that de-listing should not be limited to EU domains; it should be applied to all relevant domains, including .com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revealing Facts and Figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain pertinent statistics concerning Google’s implementation of the requests to de-link are very revealing. For example, Google has removed 40 percent of requested URLs but refused to remove the remaining 60 percent. This suggests that, contrary to the speculation of many opponents of the right, Google has not taken the easy way out by erring on the side of acceding to requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, 90 percent of the requests are pretty much a no-brainer in terms of the decision to accept or decline. Only the remaining 10 percent of cases required some fine balancing between the right to privacy and the public’s right to know. Of these minority cases, some appeals against Google’s decisions were lodged with the respective EU data protection authorities but the number is small. For example, the Information Commissioner’s Office of the United Kingdom has received some 130 such appeals. This is minuscule and falls far short of the Internet-apocalypse that doomsayers have been foreboding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one end of the spectrum are accepted cases where the prejudice against the requester is obvious and disproportionate, and privacy must prevail, for example,</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>a victim of physical violence wanted references to the assault removed;</li>\r\n	<li>a victim of rape requested removal of a link to a newspaper article about the crime;</li>\r\n	<li>a girl requested removal of a link to explicit photographs of her taken by her ex-boyfriend;</li>\r\n	<li>a woman requested the removal of a decades-old article about her husband’s murder, which included her name; and</li>\r\n	<li>a victim of a crime which occurred decades ago requested to remove links to articles which discussed the crime.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest number of removal requests was in respect of materials on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Profile Engine, Google Groups/+, Badoo and YouTube. Although they are not “newsworthy” publications and have no public interest value, they do affect ordinary people’s private lives and the de-listing of the search results did lessen the prejudice against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum are rejected cases where the public’s right to know clearly overrides the individual’s right to privacy, for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>a sex offender who wanted recent information about his conviction de-linked;</li>\r\n	<li>a person made multiple requests to remove 20 links to recent articles about his arrest for financial crimes committed in a professional capacity; and</li>\r\n	<li>a public official requested removal of a link to a student organisation’s petition demanding his removal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Way Forward</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “right to be forgotten” is still a very fluid concept and rapid developments are expected in the short and medium terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, although the ECJ ruling does not bind courts outside EU, cases involving the exercise of similar rights have recently been heard outside EU and the outcome could have implications on the exercise of the right on a worldwide basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, search engines other than Google have either commenced or will commence to handle the de-listing requests they have received and it would be interesting to watch how all the search engines respond to the Guidelines issued by the EU working party of data protection authorities, particularly those guidelines that require removal of search results to apply globally, not just EU domain search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, the appeals against the search engines’ decisions, once decided by the EU data protection authorities, will set important precedents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Google has appointed a council (comprising privacy experts and advocates of freedom of information) to advise on how to implement the ECJ decision. They are going to release a review report soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, I appeal to the opponents of the “right to be forgotten” to keep an open mind and re-consider the issues in their proper perspective. I believe it is of paramount importance to appreciate that fundamental human rights such as freedom of expression and privacy are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order, hence the need to strike a balance between them in any specific circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>* This article is an abridged and modified version of two blog posts published by the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on his website at <a href=\"http://www.pcpd.org.hk\">http://www.pcpd.org.hk</a> on 26 June 2014 and 30 December 2014 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><sup>1</sup>Google Spain SL, Google Inc v Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos, Maria Costeja Gonzalez (Court of Justice of the European Union, Case C-131/12, decision 13 May 2014.

The announcement was accurate at the time and had been legitimately published. However, as the debt had been resolved, the information became irrelevant and misleading. The ECJ thus ruled in favour of the complainant and required Google to remove or conceal the information so that it no longer appears in search results based on his name.</p>\n<p><strong>The European Commission’s Data Protection Reform</strong></p>\n<p>To put things in context, we should note that the “right to be forgotten” is a component of the European Commission’s data protection reform proposals formulated to ensure more effective control of people over their personal data, and to make it easier for businesses to operate and innovate in the European Union (“EU”) market. The proposals were endorsed by the European Parliament on 12 March 2014. They have yet to be adopted by the Council of Ministers.</p>\n<p>The ECJ ruling is therefore to some degree an affirmation of the “right to be forgotten” before it is transposed into national laws. The rationale behind this right is that citizens should be empowered to control their own identity online. If an individual no longer wants his or her personal data to be processed or stored by a data controller (the EU equivalent of “data user” in Hong Kong’s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (the “Ordinance”)), and if there is no legitimate reason for keeping it, the data should be removed from their system.</p>\n<p><strong>Opposition Against the Right</strong></p>\n<p>Specifically, the test adopted by the ECJ to invoke this right is whether the personal data is “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive” in relation to the original purpose for which the data was collected or processed, and in the light of the time that has elapsed since the original publication. The court decision recognises that the universal diffusion and accessibility of such controverted information by search engines has a disproportionate impact on privacy. It has since generated much controversy.</p>\n<p>Google, which has since the ECJ decision received more than 190,000 requests to remove links to personal information on its search engine, called the court decision “disappointing”. Not surprisingly, many advocates for freedom of information have spoken against the verdict. Some of them expressed worries that the “right to be forgotten” could spell the end to a <em>free Internet</em>. There were also fears that the exercise of the right would hinder free speech, or inhibit the right to access information. In many ways, these reactions are overblown.</p>\n<p><strong>Not Erasing History</strong></p>\n<p>First, the scope of the exercise of the “right to be forgotten” is narrow. It involves the de-listing of search results for only searches performed on the basis of the person’s name, eg, “John Smith”. If a search is performed based on other search terms (for example, “car accident in London” in which John Smith was involved), the information, inclusive of the person’s name, will not be de-listed.</p>\n<p>The “right to be forgotten”, though a convenient label, is a misnomer as no published material is required to be deleted through exercise of the right. It empowers individuals to control the online dissemination of information about them and involves the de-listing of Internet search results only. The original information continues to exist at the source and can be accessed online directly or by search using other search terms. The public record of a newspaper perpetuates regardless of the removal of the link to it from a search website. Hence any assertion that the exercise of the right will erase past events or rewrite history is misguided.</p>\n<p><strong>No Absolute “Right to be Forgotten”</strong></p>\n<p>Secondly, the right is not meant to take precedence over freedom of expression or freedom of the media. There is no absolute right to have links removed. Each removal request has to be determined on its merits.</p>\n<p>In late November 2014, a working party comprising EU data protection authorities released a set of guidelines (the “Guidelines”) on how the “right to be forgotten” is to be implemented in Europe.

Smith」)進行搜尋的結果。倘若以其他字詞(例如「倫敦車禍」，而車禍的肇事人是John Smith)進行搜尋，則包含事主名稱的資訊是不會被移除的。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「被遺忘權」只是一個便利的標籤，用詞可能不盡恰當，因為行使這項權利並不會令已發布的資料被刪除。「被遺忘權」可為個人「充權」，即個人可以控制其個人資料在網上的發布，而所移除的僅是網上搜尋的結果而已。原來的資訊會繼續存在於源頭，並可以在網上供人直接查閱，或以其他字眼搜尋查閱。無論是否從搜尋器網頁移除有關連結，曾在報章公開的紀錄將繼續在網上流傳。因此，有指行使「被遺忘權」會把過去的事件抹去或把歷史改寫，確有誤導之虞。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>沒有絕對的「被遺忘權」</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>其次，「被遺忘權」並非凌駕於言論自由或新聞自由之上，亦沒有絕對的權力可移除任何連結。每個移除連結的要求都必須按其情況作出判斷。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>一個由歐盟資料保障機關組成的工作小組，於2014年11月底公佈了一套如何在歐洲實施「被遺忘權」的指引(下稱「指引」)。他們確認有需要在個人權利和其他權利及利益之間作出平衡，最終結果可能取決於相關個人資料的性質和敏感程度，以及獲取該特定資料是否涉及公眾利益。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>該指引闡述了決定是否接納移除資訊連結時須予考慮的13項判斷準則<sup>2</sup>，當中包括：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>當事人是否公眾人物(例如政界人士、高級公職人員、[受規管]的專業人士)，以及公眾獲取有關資訊能否保障他們免受當事人公職或專業行為失當所造成的風險(例如針對醫生失職的訴訟、政界人士或商人的不誠實行為的資訊連結都不太可能被移除)；</li>\r\n	<li>資訊是否涉及公眾人物執行公務，而非純屬私人的資料，例如個人健康或家庭成員等資料(若資訊實屬涉及公務，移除資訊連結會受質疑)；及</li>\r\n	<li>資訊是否敏感(例如關於個人健康、性徵或宗教信仰等資訊)，而對資料當事人的私生活影響很大。(若資訊實屬敏感，移除資訊連結的請求受理的機會則提升。)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>依據這些準則，「被遺忘權」明顯與很多反對者所言的有落差。「被遺忘權」既不會容許公眾人物「撇清」他們不光彩的個人點滴，也不會讓對公眾負有責任的專業人士或公職人員掩飾其過去的不當行為。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>歐洲法院的裁決可否適用於香港?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>歐洲法院的裁決當然對香港的法院沒有約束力。乍看起來，並不可引用香港的 《私隱條例》行使該權利。正如東周刊案<sup>3</sup>中，上訴法庭裁定時指出「⋯⋯在收集個人資料的行為中，資料使用者必須藉該行為匯集已識辨其身分的人士，或設法或欲識辨其身分的人士的資料，有關行為才屬收集個人資料」。故此，Google並不算是資料使用者，因為它沒有收集個人資料的行為。它只是擔當中介角色，只提供一個平台，方便網上用戶在各個不同的網站中搜羅資訊。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>再者，Google只處理由歐盟國家及四個非歐盟國家(冰島、列支敦士登、挪威及瑞士)的國民所提出的刪除連結要求。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>刪除連結的地域效力</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>到目前為止，Google在處理值得刪除連結的個案中，只局限於所有其相關的歐洲網站，並沒有同樣地於google.com網站刪除有關的連結。因此，任何人如使用google.com版本的搜尋器，將能繞過歐洲法院的裁決，閱覽完整的搜尋結果。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>歐盟資料保障機關已就這異常現象在指引中述明，搜尋器在落實執行刪除連結時，必須確保資料當事人的權利受有效及完整的保護。事實上，這意味著刪除連結不應局限於歐盟網域，而是適用於所有相關的網域，包括.com。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>具啟發性的事實與數據</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>一些有關Google落實處理要求刪除連結的數據甚具啟發性，例如在處理刪除連結的申請個案中，Google只移取了百分之四十的有關連結，但拒絕移取餘下的百分之六十。這顯示Google力求謹慎，並未如很多反對「被遺忘權」人士般推測，會有求必應地處理刪除連結的申請。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>再者，百分之九十的申請幾乎不假思索就能決定是否接納。只有餘下的百分之十個案需小心平衡私隱權和公眾知情權，其中部分個案亦各自向相關的歐盟資料保障機關，就Google的判決提出上訴，但為數甚小。例如英國資訊專員公署收到約130宗上訴申請；這微不足道的數量，遠遠未如預言者所憂慮的網絡大災難般嚴重。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>話分兩頭，一些要求移除連結的個案當事人確實受到很明顯且不成比例的傷害，而捍衛私隱是義不容辭的，例如：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>一名曾遭受暴力對待的受害者，想把有關提及該次襲擊事件的資訊移除；</li>\r\n	<li>一名強姦案的受害者要求移除連結至一篇有關該宗罪案的報章報道；</li>\r\n	<li>一名女子要求移除連結至她前男朋友所拍攝的親密暴露照片；</li>\r\n	<li>一名女士要求移除一篇數十年前關於其丈夫謀殺案的文章，文中曾提及她的名字；及</li>\r\n	<li>一名於數十年前發生的罪案受害人要求移除連結至討論有關該案件的文章。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>大多數的移除要求都與社交媒體上的素材有關，例如Facebook、Profile Engine、Google Groups/+、Badoo和YouTube等平台。縱然它們不是「具新聞價值」的刊物，亦無涉及公眾利益，但它們確實影響到一般人的私生活，移除搜尋結果的確可以減輕對涉事者的傷害。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>另一邊廂，拒絕要求的個案明確地彰顯公眾知情權比個人私隱權更為重要，例如：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>一名性罪犯想移除連結至最近有關他的定罪資訊；</li>\r\n	<li>某人曾多次提出要求移除二十條連結，這些連結是接連至近期有關他因利用專業職能干犯金融罪行而被捕的文章；及</li>\r\n	<li>一名公職人員要求移除連結至一封要求罷免其職務的學生組織請願信。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>展望</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>「被遺忘權」仍是一個在演變中的新概念，預料在不久的將來會有迅速的發展。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>首先，儘管歐洲法院的裁決對歐盟以外的法院不具約束力，但涉及行使類似權利的個案，最近已在歐盟以外的地方進行審理，其結果會對是否可全球化地行使「被遺忘權」有一定的啟示。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>第二，除Google外，其他搜尋器均已着手處理或即將開始處理所收到的移除連結申請。各搜尋器會如何應對由歐盟資料保障機關的工作小組所發布的指引，尤其是當中有關移除搜尋結果適用於全球而非只限於歐盟網域所羅列的搜尋結果的要求，我們將拭目以待。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>第三，歐盟資料保障機關一旦就搜尋器案件判決的上訴作出裁定，便會成為重要的先例。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>最後，Google已任命了一個委員會(成員包括私隱專家和提倡資訊自由者)就如何落實歐洲法院的判決提出建議。他們亦將會發表一份檢討報告。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>此同時，我呼籲反對「被遺忘權」的人士保持開放態度，從正確的角度重新檢視這個議題。我認為言論自由及私隱權都是基本人權，兩者既不是絕對也無分高低，在任何情況下都應取其平衡，這是至關重要的。&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr

Rather, for most of the past 25 years he has primarily held management positions in or around lawyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Mr. Philip is the Chief Executive of the SRA, a role to which he has brought a wealth of experience in public interest regulation relating to the provision of professional services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to this appointment, Mr. Philip was the Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer at the General Medical Council (“GMC”) in the UK. He has also held senior roles in both the Legal Services Commission and the UK’s National Health Service (“NHS”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the opportunities and current challenges the SRA faces, Mr. Philip’s experience and ability to leverage it as the Chief Executive is a boon for the organisation as it moves into its next stage of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Fairly Easy Step</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip said that accepting his appointment at SRA was an “obvious evolution” from his previous role at the GMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Deputy Chief Executive of the GMC, Mr.Philip was responsible for leading all corporate work programmes, as well as delivering all of the organisation’s core regulatory work, including regulating 250,000 doctors, setting professional standards and prosecuting all infringements of the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the move from regulating doctors to regulating lawyers was a “fairly easy step” for Mr. Philip, as he has found that there are many parallels between the work and the challenges that both professions face. “Each offers professional services in increasingly challenging environments. Professional standards, such as integrity, confidentiality, independence and providing a proper standard of professional service are common in both fields.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Life as the Chief Executive</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip said he hasn’t really noticed what it <em>feels</em> like to be the Chief Executive – outside of being very busy – but indicated that this role has given him the opportunity to work on very interesting and challenging issues in a fast-paced setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the issues he has faced during his tenure, he said the most challenging has been “building a relationship with the profession; developing a dialogue that will allow [the SRA] to properly understand the market and how it should be regulated in order to get the balance right between protecting the public and allowing legal businesses to grow, unhindered by red tape and regulatory bureaucracy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing this dialogue is vital for the SRA to devise a workable approach to regulating lawyers across different specialties. “Although we talk about the [legal] profession as being one profession, it really is made up of lawyers working in many markets, with very different challenges,” Mr. Philip explained. “International lawyers doing M&amp;A work have a very different job and face very different challenges to colleagues doing publically funded work, or those doing criminal or family work. And that is a factor we are increasingly taking into account in the way that we regulate lawyers. A one-size-fits-all approach is simply no longer good enough given the differences in the practice areas of lawyers.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip also noted that the internationalisation of the practice of law has raised many challenges for the SRA, as it has for other regulators around the world. From the increased inflow of overseas law firms and practitioners into England to English firms setting up in ever increasing numbers in a growing number of jurisdictions, there has been a stronger push for the SRA to understand the regulatory models of other jurisdictions and obtain the information they need to verify qualifications. “There is a challenge for all legal regulators in communicating and learning from each other. This is why we are promoting the development of an international network of legal regulators, which the Hong Kong Law Society is actively engaged in,” Mr. Philip said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for issues that have piqued Mr.Philip’s interest, he said watching how legal businesses are reconfiguring their ownership structures has been fascinating. He also thinks it has been interesting to watch the market open up, with three of the big four accountancy firms now regulated as law firms. “I suspect this will drive some fairly fundamental changes in how legal services are delivered in the future.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovation in the Legal Sector</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation is driving growth in the legal sector, as in any other sector, and a wider range of services in a competitive market can only be good news for the public. However, Mr. Philip noted that changes in the market have raised a host of regulatory issues which must be examined and addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, “significant questions remain about which elements of the current regulatory framework most significantly impede innovation,” Mr.Philip said. “Or, indeed, whether some elements of regulation may actually be encouraging or stimulating innovation as some research on other sectors suggests.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip pointed to three main issues related to innovation where better understanding is needed:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>to understand what innovation means in the context of the legal services sector;</li>\r\n	<li>to explore what is driving innovation in the legal services sector, including the impact of competition in driving organisations to try new approaches; and</li>\r\n	<li>to understand the barriers and enablers of innovation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First Large-Scale Study on Innovation in the Legal Sector</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explore these issues, the SRA and the Legal Services Board enlisted the help of the Enterprise Research Centre (“ERC”) at Warwick Business School to conduct a study on innovation in the legal sector, whereby ERC reviewed the findings of a series of qualitative case studies and quantitative surveys of 1,500 organisations delivering legal services in England and Wales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Findings from the study suggest that legal professionals, including solicitors and barristers, are becoming more innovative in the organisation and management of their businesses,” Mr.Philip said. “The research shows that law firms and solicitors are capitalising on how the market is opening up by developing new ways to do business and offer more services.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip noted that the study also found:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>alternative business structures (“ABS”) are 13–15 percent more likely to introduce new legal services than other types of regulated solicitor firms;</li>\r\n	<li>over a quarter of all providers have introduced a new service in the last three years;</li>\r\n	<li>80 percent of legal organisations feel that they have a culture and leadership which is open to new ideas;</li>\r\n	<li>40 percent of organisations have put in place organisational procedures to support innovation and the development of new ideas;</li>\r\n	<li>innovation extends service range, improves quality and attracts new clients; and</li>\r\n	<li>a majority of providers see regulation as broadly neutral to positive for innovation but there are some key areas where providers believe regulation has a negative impact on innovation, such as client accounts and client complaints.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>“A market which is welcoming of innovation is attractive to investors and potential new entrants, and encourages existing businesses to differentiate and to compete. This report suggests that legal professionals are innovative but it also indicates that more can be done to meet the significant unmet legal needs that continue to exist,” he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the SRA’s first large scale study on this topic. Mr.Philip said the findings have helped the regulator better understand the new and different approaches law firms and others are taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We think we are doing all the right things – opening up the market and reducing red tape – which gives firms room to grow and innovate.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Levelling the Playing Field</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all the change afoot, the SRA has made it a priority to ensure a level playing field for all types of legal service providers to encourage innovation and growth, while ensuring appropriate consumer protection. These reforms, Mr. Philip noted, follow-on from changes the SRA made last year to open up the market to different business models and one-stop shop services (eg, multi-disciplinary practices created through ABSs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By way of background, Mr. Philip explained that since 2011, non-lawyers have, for the first time, been allowed to own, manage or invest in a law firm in the UK. “This was enabled by the Legal Services Act (2007), which opened up the legal services market by providing for the introduction of legal services through ABS. This has sometimes been referred to as the ‘Tesco Law’, indicating that supermarkets, amongst others, could provide legal services as ABSs.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Although we have authorised 369 ABSs, certain businesses have been notable by their absence, particularly firms offering a range of professional services (multi-disciplinary practices) such as accountancy, surveying or financial services that were also regulated elsewhere. We therefore changed the rules in October 2014 to make it easier for multi-disciplinary practices to offer SRA regulated legal services by removing elements of ‘double regulation’.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Changes to the Separate Business Rule (“SBR”) – which mean that solicitors can own or be connected to separate businesses providing non-reserved legal services – were agreed by the SRA Board at its meeting on 3 June 2015. The original purpose of the SBR was to prevent solicitors from having links to separate businesses outside the remit of regulation.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The opening up of the legal market already allows other types of businesses to own law firms and deliver innovative services.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As part of the same package of reforms, the rules on what activities can be undertaken within solicitors firms have been relaxed, making it easier for those firms to create ‘one-stop shops’ for professional services.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“By changing the SBR, law firms can own separate businesses, allowing them to compete on a level playing field with multi-disciplinary practices created through ABSs; the changes provide the opportunity for firms to take advantage and deliver innovative services. We have no reason to think there will be any consumer detriment, but we will be monitoring this.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional Reforms on the Horizon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Philip said that the SRA is now looking into what more it should do to give solicitors even more flexibility in the future. “For example, the SBR amendments free up the restrictions on solicitors owning, being owned by and managing separate businesses that carry out non-reserved legal activities but they do not remove the restrictions preventing solicitors in those businesses from delivering services to the public. Later this year we will issue a paper that sets out the next phase of our regulatory reform programme and this will include our plans to review the restrictions on solicitors practising in non-authorised businesses.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The proposed reform of our handbook is the next step in our wider programme of reform in how we regulate legal services,” Mr. Philip continued. “We know that there are some significant issues with the current handbook. For example, it is hundreds of pages long and very complex in places. It has evolved piecemeal over time, which has led to some inconsistencies that can be difficult for solicitors to interpret. It is essential that the SRA’s Handbook reflects the way we want to regulate. Our work on the Handbook falls squarely within our aims of increased competition, innovation and growth to serve consumers of legal services better.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Business structures are not important to consumers,” Mr. Philip added, “what is important is accessibility, price and quality of services. We have therefore been moving away from an approach that is restrictive as to the structures firms choose to adopt. Our goal is to ensure that there is clarity around who regulation applies to, how it applies to different business models and what our requirements are.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the benefits of opening up the legal market are many – for both legal service providers and the public – non-lawyer involvement presents a number of challenges for the regulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some significant ethical concerns Mr.Philip identified include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>a lack of regulatory history held by the SRA on non-lawyers to determine past behaviour;</li>\r\n	<li>a lack of understanding by non-lawyers of how a regulatory regime such as the SRA’s works; and</li>\r\n	<li>concerns that in a predominantly non-lawyer owned/managed ABS, the ethical balance provided by the lawyer manager / Compliance Officer for Legal Practice (“COLP”) may not be sufficient to override higher considerations of non-lawyers (eg, commercial factors).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>But Mr. Philip explained that there are a number of ways to address these challenges, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>financial and criminal checks;</li>\r\n	<li>getting information from any other regulators they may have (eg, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (“ICAEW”) or the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”));</li>\r\n	<li>ensuring robust procedures within firms to give sufficient control to lawyer manager / COLP to fulfil their regulatory duties; and</li>\r\n	<li>emphasising to non-lawyers the need to familiarise themselves with and understand the SRA Handbook as it applies to them and their firm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>“Up until November 2014, this was a potentially significant problem as the SRA regulated all legal work in the business, whether reserved or not, which could conflict with, for example, FCA or ICAEW regulation of non-reserved legal activities. Since November 2014, we have introduced a multi-disciplinary practice (“MDP”) framework which allows us to limit our regulation to exclude work suitably regulated by another regulator so the risk for conflicts and overlaps is significantly reduced. Gaps are not an issue as the MDP licences we issue specify only the work that falls out of our regulation (as covered by the other regulator) as opposed to trying to list all work that might come within it so, for example, we may say SRA regulated work will be all reserved legal activity and all non-reserved legal activity that is not covered by ICAEW regulation. As a result, all legal work would be regulated by one or other of the regulators.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Regulatory Overhaul Has Been Worthwhile</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Hong Kong Law Society has been carefully studying the pros and cons of the ABS model and considering UK-style ABS reforms, Mr. Philip concluded the interview by explaining why he believes the regulatory overhaul in the UK has been worthwhile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We believe that the regulatory changes such as allowing firms to offer a one-stop-shop for clients, without worrying about duplicate regulation, will enable new firms to flourish and consumers to access services in new ways, whilst at the same time protecting consumers and keeping costs as low as possible. As part of our wider package of regulatory reform, this is about making regulation simpler, not being restrictive on business models and making business easier.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have been authorising ABSs for some years now and it has brought new businesses and new thinking in our legal services market. It seems to be working for us and we think that the steps we have taken to make sure traditional businesses can compete on a level playing field will build on that success,” Mr. Philip concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width:100%\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"width:25%;padding:5px\">\r\n			<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Sep2015/COVETSTORY_CS-head_opt.jpeg\" style=\"width:18%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n			<p>Mr. Paul Philip<br />\r\n			Chief Executive, Solicitors Regulation Authority (UK)</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"padding:5px\">\r\n			<p>Mr. Philip took up his post as Chief Executive of the SRA on 1 February 2014.

「研究顯示，律師行和律師開發營商新途徑，提供更多服務，藉此隨着市場開放而獲益。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生稱上述研究亦發現：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>13–15%的開放式合股經營法律及其他服務(ABS)相較其他種類的受監管律師行，更有可能推出新的法律服務；</li>\r\n	<li>過去三年，所有提供者中逾四份之一已推出新服務；</li>\r\n	<li>80%的法律機構覺得它們的機構文化和領導層都接受創新意念；</li>\r\n	<li>40%的機構已為機構制定程序，支持創新和開發新意念；</li>\r\n	<li>創意擴大服務範圍，提升質素、吸引新客戶；及</li>\r\n	<li>大多數提供者認為，監管對創意基本上是中立至正面的，但提供者認為，對於一些主要範疇，監管對創新有負面影響，例如客戶賬戶和客戶投訴。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>「歡迎創意的市場對投資者及新參與者具有吸引力，並且鼓勵現有企業突圍而出，與同業競爭。這報告顯示，法律專業人員富有創新精神，但亦指出，要滿足現時繼續存在但仍遠遠未滿足到的法律需求，我們還能做得更多。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生認為，這是SRA第一次就這題目進行的大規模研究，研究結果幫助監管機構了解律師行及其他企業現時採用的其他新方式。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「我們覺得自己正在做的事都是正確的――開放市場，減少繁文縟節――都給律師行發展和發揮創意的空間。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>維持公平競爭</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>隨着所有改革已經開始，被SRA列為首要工作的是：在確保消費者得到合適保障之餘，同時確保所有類別的法律服務提供者享有公平競爭的營商環境，鼓勵創意，推動發展。Philip先生表示，有關改革是接續SRA去年開放市場，容許不同經營模式和一站式服務(例如透過ABS增設的綜合性專業服務模式)參與之後進行的。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生詳細解說一些背景資料：自從2011年以來，非律師首次獲准在英國擁有、管理或投資律師行。「這有賴《 2007年法律服務法》(Legal Services Act(2007))有關透過ABS推出法律服務的規定，開放法律服務市場。此法有時被稱為『Tesco法』，暗示除了別的以外，超市也可以ABS模式提供法律服務。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「雖然我們已認可369項ABS，值得注意的是，一直不見某些公司出現，特別是提供會計服務、測量服務或金融服務等等多種專業服務(綜合性專業服務模式)的公司，它們在別處同樣受到監管。因此，我們於2014年10月修改規定，刪除『雙重監管』(double regulation)，讓綜合性專業服務模式更容易提供受到SRA監管的法律服務。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「獨立公司規定(Separate Business Rule)的修訂――容許律師擁有提供非保留法律服務的獨立公司，或與之建立關連――於2015年6月3日在SRA委員會會議上獲得通過。SRA最早的目的，是防止律師與不在SRA監管職權範圍內的獨立公司有任何聯繫。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「隨着法律市場開放，其他種類的公司已獲准擁有律師行及提供創意服務。藉着修訂獨立公司規定，所有律師行皆可以擁有獨立經營模式，在公平競爭的環境中與ABS競爭。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「作為上述改革的其中一環，有關什麽活動可由律師行進行的規定已經放寬，現時律師行可更輕易地設立提供專業服務的『一站式中心』。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「藉着修訂獨立公司規定，律師行能夠擁有獨立公司，因而能夠在公平競爭的環境中，與透過ABS設立的綜合性專業服務模式競爭；修訂規定給律師行提供從中得益及提供創意服務的機會。我們無理由認為任何消費者會蒙受損害，但我們會繼續監察情況。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>其他現存的改革</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生稱SRA現正研究，SRA應再做些什麽以容許律師將來有更大彈性。「例如修訂獨立公司規定便消除了對律師的限制，使律師能夠擁有及管理從事非保留法律活動的獨立公司，或者由這類公司擁有，但沒有消除阻止從事這類業務的律師向公眾提供服務的限制。我們會在今年稍後時間發布文件，訂明我們監管改革計劃的下一階段，包括我們計劃檢討對從事非認可業務律師的限制。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「我們就如何監管法律服務制定涵蓋範圍廣泛的改革計劃，建議修訂手冊是計劃中的下一步行動。」Philip先生續說。「我們知道，現時的手冊有一些嚴重的問題。例如：篇幅極長，也要「捐窿捐罅」才能難找。手冊隨着時間而變得零碎，導致出現一些前後不一致的地方，律師理解內容時可能都感到困難。SRA的手冊必須反映我們用來監管的方式。我們在手冊上下的工夫正切合我們加強競爭、創意和發展，為法律服務消費者提供更佳服務的目標。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「經營模式對消費者並不重要。」Philip先生補充說。「重要的是取用服務的方便程度、服務的價格和質素。因此，我們在逐漸取消對律師行選擇採用的經營模式造成限制的方法。我們的目標，是確保清晰闡明監管規定的適用對象、如何將規定應用到各類經營模式，以及我們所規定的是什麽。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>道德問題</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>雖然開放法律市場的好處多得不勝枚舉――對法律服務提供者和公眾皆如是――但容讓非律師參與卻對業界的道德價值產生多個難題。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生點出一些重要的道德問題，包括：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>SRA缺乏監管非律師的經驗，難以決定非律師過去的行為；</li>\r\n	<li>給SRA所知甚少的人∕公司有機會接觸到一些社會上亟需援助的人；</li>\r\n	<li>非律師不理解監管制度(例如SRA的監管制度)的運作；及</li>\r\n	<li>關注到在主要由非律師擁有∕管理的ABS中，由律師管理人∕合規主任(法律執業)提供合符道德的平衡，可能不足以凌駕非律師更高的考慮(例如商業因素)。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>但Philip先生解釋，現時有多種應付挑戰的方法，例如：</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>財務狀況和犯罪背景調查；</li>\r\n	<li>從任何其他監管機構取得它們有的資料(例如英格蘭及威爾斯特許會計師公會(ICAEW)或金融市場行為監管局(FCA))；</li>\r\n	<li>確保律師行程序穩妥，給律師管理人∕合規主任(法律執業)足夠履行其監管職責的控制權；及</li>\r\n	<li>向非律師強調有需要熟悉和了解SRA手冊，因為手冊對他們及他們的律師行適用。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>「一直到2014年11月，SRA監管業內提供的所有法律服務，不管是否保留的，潛在着一個嚴重的問題，這問題有可能與FCA或ICAEW等對非保留法律活動的監管有衝突。自2014年11月以後，我們推出了綜合性專業服務模式的框架，讓我們能夠限制我們的監管規定，不輕易將受到另一監管機構適當監管的服務排除在外，大大降低衝突和重叠的風險。由於我們發出的綜合性專業服務模式牌照，只指明不在我們監管範圍內的服務(受到其他監管機構監管)，而不是嘗試詳列所有可能在監管範圍內的服務(譬如說，我們可以說，受到SRA監管的服務都是保留的法律活動，而不受ICAEW監管的都是非保留法律活動)，因而存在差距不是個問題。因此，所有法律服務不是受到一間監管機構監管，便是受到其他監管機構監管。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>全面修訂監管制度是物有所值的</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>由於香港律師會已仔細研究ABS模式的利弊，也詳細考慮英國式的ABS改革，Philip先生在訪問結束時，便解釋自己相信英國全面修訂監管制度是物有所值的原因。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「我們認為，改革監管制度，例如容讓律師行向客戶提供一站式服務，不擔憂雙重監管的問題，既有助新律師行蓬勃發展，讓消費者能透過新方式得到服務，但同時亦保障消費者，將成本維持於最低水平。我們涵蓋範圍更廣的監管改革其中的一環，是簡化監管，不限制業務模式，令業務經營更為輕易。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip先生總結﹕「我們已經委託了ABS好一段日子，而它亦已將新的業務和新的思維帶進我們的法律服務市場。我們對這情況感到滿意，並認為我們為了確保傳統企業能夠在公平的環境下競爭所採取的步驟，將會建立在這一項成功的舉措上。」</p>\r\n\r\n<table

Act(2007))有關透過ABS推出法律服務的規定，開放法律服務市場。此法有時被稱為『Tesco法』，暗示除了別的以外，超市也可以ABS模式提供法律服務。」</p>\n<p>「雖然我們已認可369項ABS，值得注意的是，一直不見某些公司出現，特別是提供會計服務、測量服務或金融服務等等多種專業服務(綜合性專業服務模式)的公司，它們在別處同樣受到監管。因此，我們於2014年10月修改規定，刪除『雙重監管』(double regulation)，讓綜合性專業服務模式更容易提供受到SRA監管的法律服務。」</p>\n<p>「獨立公司規定(Separate Business Rule)的修訂――容許律師擁有提供非保留法律服務的獨立公司，或與之建立關連――於2015年6月3日在SRA委員會會議上獲得通過。SRA最早的目的，是防止律師與不在SRA監管職權範圍內的獨立公司有任何聯繫。」</p>\n<p>「隨着法律市場開放，其他種類的公司已獲准擁有律師行及提供創意服務。藉着修訂獨立公司規定，所有律師行皆可以擁有獨立經營模式，在公平競爭的環境中與ABS競爭。」</p>\n<p>「作為上述改革的其中一環，有關什麽活動可由律師行進行的規定已經放寬，現時律師行可更輕易地設立提供專業服務的『一站式中心』。」</p>\n<p>「藉着修訂獨立公司規定，律師行能夠擁有獨立公司，因而能夠在公平競爭的環境中，與透過ABS設立的綜合性專業服務模式競爭；修訂規定給律師行提供從中得益及提供創意服務的機會。我們無理由認為任何消費者會蒙受損害，但我們會繼續監察情況。」</p>\n<p><strong>其他現存的改革</strong></p>\n<p>Philip先生稱SRA現正研究，SRA應再做些什麽以容許律師將來有更大彈性。「例如修訂獨立公司規定便消除了對律師的限制，使律師能夠擁有及管理從事非保留法律活動的獨立公司，或者由這類公司擁有，但沒有消除阻止從事這類業務的律師向公眾提供服務的限制。我們會在今年稍後時間發布文件，訂明我們監管改革計劃的下一階段，包括我們計劃檢討對從事非認可業務律師的限制。」</p>\n<p>「我們就如何監管法律服務制定涵蓋範圍廣泛的改革計劃，建議修訂手冊是計劃中的下一步行動。」Philip先生續說。「我們知道，現時的手冊有一些嚴重的問題。例如：篇幅極長，也要「捐窿捐罅」才能難找。手冊隨着時間而變得零碎，導致出現一些前後不一致的地方，律師理解內容時可能都感到困難。SRA的手冊必須反映我們用來監管的方式。我們在手冊上下的工夫正切合我們加強競爭、創意和發展，為法律服務消費者提供更佳服務的目標。」</p>\n<p>「經營模式對消費者並不重要。」Philip先生補充說。「重要的是取用服務的方便程度、服務的價格和質素。因此，我們在逐漸取消對律師行選擇採用的經營模式造成限制的方法。我們的目標，是確保清晰闡明監管規定的適用對象、如何將規定應用到各類經營模式，以及我們所規定的是什麽。」</p>\n<p><strong>道德問題</strong></p>\n<p>雖然開放法律市場的好處多得不勝枚舉――對法律服務提供者和公眾皆如是――但容讓非律師參與卻對業界的道德價值產生多個難題。</p>\n<p>Philip先生點出一些重要的道德問題，包括：</p>\n<ul><li>SRA缺乏監管非律師的經驗，難以決定非律師過去的行為；</li>\n<li>給SRA所知甚少的人∕公司有機會接觸到一些社會上亟需援助的人；</li>\n<li>非律師不理解監管制度(例如SRA的監管制度)的運作；及</li>\n<li>關注到在主要由非律師擁有∕管理的ABS中，由律師管理人∕合規主任(法律執業)提供合符道德的平衡，可能不足以凌駕非律師更高的考慮(例如商業因素)。</li>\n</ul><p>但Philip先生解釋，現時有多種應付挑戰的方法，例如：</p>\n<ul><li>財務狀況和犯罪背景調查；</li>\n<li>從任何其他監管機構取得它們有的資料(例如英格蘭及威爾斯特許會計師公會(ICAEW)或金融市場行為監管局(FCA))；</li>\n<li>確保律師行程序穩妥，給律師管理人∕合規主任(法律執業)足夠履行其監管職責的控制權；及</li>\n<li>向非律師強調有需要熟悉和了解SRA手冊，因為手冊對他們及他們的律師行適用。</li>\n</ul><p>「一直到2014年11月，SRA監管業內提供的所有法律服務，不管是否保留的，潛在着一個嚴重的問題，這問題有可能與FCA或ICAEW等對非保留法律活動的監管有衝突。自2014年11月以後，我們推出了綜合性專業服務模式的框架，讓我們能夠限制我們的監管規定，不輕易將受到另一監管機構適當監管的服務排除在外，大大降低衝突和重叠的風險。由於我們發出的綜合性專業服務模式牌照，只指明不在我們監管範圍內的服務(受到其他監管機構監管)，而不是嘗試詳列所有可能在監管範圍內的服務(譬如說，我們可以說，受到SRA監管的服務都是保留的法律活動，而不受ICAEW監管的都是非保留法律活動)，因而存在差距不是個問題。因此，所有法律服務不是受到一間監管機構監管，便是受到其他監管機構監管。」</p>\n<p><strong>全面修訂監管制度是物有所值的</strong></p>\n<p>由於香港律師會已仔細研究ABS模式的利弊，也詳細考慮英國式的ABS改革，Philip先生在訪問結束時，便解釋自己相信英國全面修訂監管制度是物有所值的原因。</p>\n<p>「我們認為，改革監管制度，例如容讓律師行向客戶提供一站式服務，不擔憂雙重監管的問題，既有助新律師行蓬勃發展，讓消費者能透過新方式得到服務，但同時亦保障消費者，將成本維持於最低水平。我們涵蓋範圍更廣的監管改革其中的一環，是簡化監管，不限制業務模式，令業務經營更為輕易。」</p>\n<p>Philip先生總結﹕「我們已經委託了ABS好一段日子，而它亦已將新的業務和新的思維帶進我們的法律服務市場。我們對這情況感到滿意，並認為我們為了確保傳統企業能夠在公平的環境下競爭所採取的步驟，將會建立在這一項成功的舉措上。」</p>\n<table

No, they don’t call”</em>. This is a line from <em>“Michael Clayton”</em> (2007); another film about law and the movies and one that any new entrant to the profession should be requested to watch, as part of their induction training, in addition to reviewing some of the scam prevention guidance referred to at the end of this <em>Industry Insights</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As readers will have noted in the local press, telephone scams in Hong Kong are common. Indeed, there is an industry of scam artists linked to organised crime and the money they handle is proceeds of crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One recent <em>modus operandi</em> of some scam artists is to pretend to be security officials from the Mainland and telephone victims accusing them of having been caught up in some illegal activity that requires payment of a “fine”. In particular, some fraudsters are reported to have told victims that their courier packages to the Mainland have been found to contain illegal contents (for example, fake documents) requiring payment of a “fine”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The different sorts of scams evolve. By the time of publication of this <em>Industry Insights</em> there are likely to have been other scams in Hong Kong (many of which use telephone and/or email and originate from other jurisdictions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind, it worth bearing in mind the captioned line from <em>“Michael Clayton”</em>; a line between George Clooney, playing a US attorney, and a client in fear that the police are about to telephone him at home in connection with a suspected crime. Mainland security officials or police are unlikely to call in connection with crime investigation; they prefer to visit “persons of interest” and arrange interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If someone receives a telephone call from a caller claiming to represent “security officials” and seeking payment of money they should report this to the Hong Kong Police Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other telephone scams this year have involved persons trying to impersonate agencies in Hong Kong such as: (i) the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (“HKMA”) in order to obtain (among other things) customers’ confidential personal information and (ii) the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) in order to offer “investments”. The HKMA would not telephone a bank customer asking for his or her bank details and the SFC does not offer investment opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Readers and their clients should remain vigilant. The HKMA (and the Hong Kong Association of Banks) and SFC websites contain some useful guidance and warnings.

In July 2015 alone, his office issued: (i) an Information Leaflet on minimising data privacy risks when using smartphones; (ii) an Information Leaflet on cloud computing; (iii) a Guidance Note on the collection and use of biometric data; and (iv) a media statement urging the government to tighten controls over the protection of personal data on public registers in the current era of big data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chiang’s tenure as the Privacy Commissioner will be remembered for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The launch of the Privacy Management Programme on 18February 2014, an initiative that encourages organisations to proactively embrace personal data protection as part of their general corporate governance responsibilities, rather than merely as a legal compliance issue;</li>\r\n	<li>Active participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”) activities, including assisting in the drafting of the Cross Border Privacy Rules in 2011, as part of the APEC Data Privacy Framework, which promotes a consistent approach to data privacy protection in the Asia Pacific region.</li>\r\n	<li>Issuance of 17 Guidance Notes, eight Information Leaflets, one Code of Practice and two explanatory documents, many of which relate to technological advancements and their impact on data privacy (eg, mobile apps, biometric data, drones, cloud computing, use of public data) and the provision of specific guidance to certain industries (eg, the banking and finance industry, information technology service providers, the insurance industry, etc);</li>\r\n	<li>Active enforcement of the legislation, with 31 Investigation Reports out of the 44 Investigation Reports ever issued since the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (“PDPO”) was enacted, being issued during Mr.Chiang’s five year tenure, with the actual number of enforcement notices peaking at 90 for the year 2014. The apex of enforcement actions was the Investigation Report that was triggered by the Octopus cards debacle, which led to amendments to the PDPO, and the referral of cases for prosecution, notably the one resulting in the first imprisonment ever for a breach of the PDPO, as a result of a false statement made during an investigation (an offence under S.50B(1)(c)(i) of the PDPO).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A New Era?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the changing of the guards on 4 August 2015, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has issued the Guidance Note on Electioneering Activities (no doubt a nod in the direction of the upcoming District Council elections), and has issued statements in connection with the much publicised first conviction for a breach of the direct marketing provisions. In media interviews, the new Privacy Commissioner has stressed the need to balance the protection of individuals’ rights with safeguarding the role of Hong Kong in the global marketplace by maintaining a free flow of information. A significant emphasis will be placed on educating businesses, with the aim of moving the needle from compliance to accountability. These are well-known tunes, but the magic, as in music, will lie in their “arrangement” and the skills and technique of the “new conductor” leading our top-class orchestra for the next five years.</p>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:93:\"<p>Gabriela Kennedy, Partner, and Karen H.F.

In July 2015 alone, his office issued: (i) an Information Leaflet on minimising data privacy risks when using smartphones; (ii) an Information Leaflet on cloud computing; (iii) a Guidance Note on the collection and use of biometric data; and (iv) a media statement urging the government to tighten controls over the protection of personal data on public registers in the current era of big data.</p>\n<p>Mr. Chiang’s tenure as the Privacy Commissioner will be remembered for:</p>\n<ul><li>The launch of the Privacy Management Programme on 18February 2014, an initiative that encourages organisations to proactively embrace personal data protection as part of their general corporate governance responsibilities, rather than merely as a legal compliance issue;</li>\n<li>Active participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”) activities, including assisting in the drafting of the Cross Border Privacy Rules in 2011, as part of the APEC Data Privacy Framework, which promotes a consistent approach to data privacy protection in the Asia Pacific region.</li>\n<li>Issuance of 17 Guidance Notes, eight Information Leaflets, one Code of Practice and two explanatory documents, many of which relate to technological advancements and their impact on data privacy (eg, mobile apps, biometric data, drones, cloud computing, use of public data) and the provision of specific guidance to certain industries (eg, the banking and finance industry, information technology service providers, the insurance industry, etc);</li>\n<li>Active enforcement of the legislation, with 31 Investigation Reports out of the 44 Investigation Reports ever issued since the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (“PDPO”) was enacted, being issued during Mr.Chiang’s five year tenure, with the actual number of enforcement notices peaking at 90 for the year 2014. The apex of enforcement actions was the Investigation Report that was triggered by the Octopus cards debacle, which led to amendments to the PDPO, and the referral of cases for prosecution, notably the one resulting in the first imprisonment ever for a breach of the PDPO, as a result of a false statement made during an investigation (an offence under S.50B(1)(c)(i) of the PDPO).</li>\n</ul><p><strong>A New Era?</strong></p>\n<p>Since the changing of the guards on 4 August 2015, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has issued the Guidance Note on Electioneering Activities (no doubt a nod in the direction of the upcoming District Council elections), and has issued statements in connection with the much publicised first conviction for a breach of the direct marketing provisions. In media interviews, the new Privacy Commissioner has stressed the need to balance the protection of individuals’ rights with safeguarding the role of Hong Kong in the global marketplace by maintaining a free flow of information. A significant emphasis will be placed on educating businesses, with the aim of moving the needle from compliance to accountability. These are well-known tunes, but the magic, as in music, will lie in their “arrangement” and the skills and technique of the “new conductor” leading our top-class orchestra for the next five years.</p>\n\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:92:\"<p>Gabriela Kennedy, Partner, and Karen H.F.

&ldquo;Council&rdquo;) held a disciplinary inquiry in relation to M, a medical practitioner. The inquiry was conducted in public and the names of the members of the Council were disclosed on name plates placed in front of them. After M was sentenced, the Council was alerted by the media that M did not have a clear record and reviewed its original decision. The written decision of the Council only stated the name of the Chairman. The matter was reported in the news. X, a member of the public unconnected with the case, enquired with the Council of the identity of members sitting at the inquiry, the Legal Adviser of the Council and the defence counsel. X refused to answer repeated enquiries by the Council as to his purpose of the inquiry and intended use of the information. X applied for judicial review to quash the Council&rsquo;s decision in refusing to disclose the requested information (the &ldquo;Decision&rdquo;). The Council contended that Data Protection Principle (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) 3 in Sch. 1 of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) (the &ldquo;Ordinance&rdquo;) applied to restrict disclosure to X and that none of the statutory exemptions from DPP applied.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, allowing the application, quashing the Decision and remitting the matter to the Council, that:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		The Council had taken into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the restriction in DPP 3, and failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the requirements of the principle of open justice. If disclosure was required or authorised by the common law principle of open justice, DPP 3 posed no obstacle to disclosure because the exemption in s. 60B(a) applied.

The inquiry was conducted in public and the names of the members of the Council were disclosed on name plates placed in front of them. After M was sentenced, the Council was alerted by the media that M did not have a clear record and reviewed its original decision. The written decision of the Council only stated the name of the Chairman. The matter was reported in the news. X, a member of the public unconnected with the case, enquired with the Council of the identity of members sitting at the inquiry, the Legal Adviser of the Council and the defence counsel. X refused to answer repeated enquiries by the Council as to his purpose of the inquiry and intended use of the information. X applied for judicial review to quash the Council’s decision in refusing to disclose the requested information (the “Decision”). The Council contended that Data Protection Principle (“DPP”) 3 in Sch. 1 of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) (the “Ordinance”) applied to restrict disclosure to X and that none of the statutory exemptions from DPP applied.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, allowing the application, quashing the Decision and remitting the matter to the Council, that:</p>\n<ul><li>\n		The Council had taken into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the restriction in DPP 3, and failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the requirements of the principle of open justice. If disclosure was required or authorised by the common law principle of open justice, DPP 3 posed no obstacle to disclosure because the exemption in s. 60B(a) applied. However, the fact that the exemption applied did not imply that the Council was required to make disclosure.</li>\n<li>\n		<em>(Obiter)</em> Disclosing the names to X would not constitute a “new purpose” as defined in s. 3(4) of Sch. 1. There was no evidence of any statement of the purpose for collecting personal data. In ascertaining the original purpose or any directly related purpose, it was legitimate to have regard to “the reasonable expectations of the data subject”.

D, under an agreement entitled &ldquo;Merchant Cash Advance Sale and Purchase Contract&rdquo; (the &ldquo;MCA Contract&rdquo;), purchased a fixed amount of a merchant&rsquo;s future credit card receivables (the &ldquo;Purchased Amount&rdquo;) and in return for a one-off upfront merchant cash advance at a discount (the &ldquo;MCA&rdquo;).

&ldquo;Mark&rdquo;). Respondent (hereinafter &ldquo;R&rdquo;) was an individual domiciled in the Russian Federation who registered the domain name <lenovo.biz>(the &ldquo;Disputed Domain Name&rdquo;).</lenovo.biz></p>\n<p>\n	<lenovo.biz>\n	<p>\n		On 26 March 2014, C filed an UDRP complaint against R with the Hong Kong Office of the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (the &ldquo;ADNDRC&rdquo;), seeking transfer of the Disputed Domain Name based on the elements specified below:-</p>\n	<ul>\n		<li>\n			C had spent substantial time and effort for advertising and promotion of the Mark throughout the world and was the largest personal computer vendor by unit sales in 2014. C further claimed that the Disputed Domain Name was highly similar to its domain name <lenovo.com>and registered trademark (the &ldquo;Trademark&rdquo;) which had been registered in multiple jurisdictions including the Russian Federation, being the domicile of R.</lenovo.com></li>\n		<li>\n			the Mark was a word created by C and had no literature meaning to it. R was not affiliated or authorised in any way with C to use the Trademark and R had no fair reason to use the Mark as the distinguishing part of the Disputed Domain Name.</li>\n		<li>\n			the Disputed Domain Name was not in use. R&rsquo;s passive holding of the Disputed Domain Name with the knowledge of C and C&rsquo;s Trademarks and without having rights or legitimate interests in it constituted bad faith. C asserted that R&rsquo;s purpose of cybersquatting the Disputed Domain Name was to obtain improper profits.</li>\n	</ul>\n	<lenovo.com>\n	<p>\n		R did not file a formal Response using the designated response form, but sent an email to the ADNDRC within the required period of time for the Response, primarily asserting that:</p>\n	<ul>\n		<li>\n			The Disputed Domain Name was available for registration and could be registered by anyone.</li>\n		<li>\n			The Disputed Domain Name was a common word in several languages. R registered the Disputed Domain Name for non-commercial purpose and the registration was not a violation.</li>\n		<li>\n			R did not know that the Mark was a registered trademark and had spent resources for the development of a non-commercial website.</li>\n	</ul>\n	<p>\n		Nonetheless, R also indicated his readiness to transfer the Disputed Domain Name to C.</p>\n	<p>\n		<strong>Held</strong>, granting the remedy sought, that:</p>\n	<p>\n		The Panel was not persuaded by R that the Mark was a dictionary word. Conversely, the Panel found that the Mark was a fancy word with a high level of inherent distinctiveness which consumers associated exclusively with C, and it was identical to the Disputed Domain Name.</p>\n	<p>\n		The Panel did not accept R&rsquo;s argument that the Disputed Domain Name was available for registration and could be registered by anyone. As evident from the provision of the UDRP, the mere availability of a domain name for registration does not per se mean that it could be registered by anyone disregard of or in violation of the rights of third parties. In this case, the Trademark had been officially published in the Russian Federation, the domicile of R, and any person could check its status by accessing the official public database of the Russian Federal Institute of Industrial Property.

Respondent (hereinafter “R”) was an individual domiciled in the Russian Federation who registered the domain name <lenovo.biz>(the “Disputed Domain Name”).</lenovo.biz></p>\n<p>\n	<lenovo.biz></lenovo.biz></p>\n<p>\n		On 26 March 2014, C filed an UDRP complaint against R with the Hong Kong Office of the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (the “ADNDRC”), seeking transfer of the Disputed Domain Name based on the elements specified below:-</p>\n<ul><li>\n			C had spent substantial time and effort for advertising and promotion of the Mark throughout the world and was the largest personal computer vendor by unit sales in 2014. C further claimed that the Disputed Domain Name was highly similar to its domain name <lenovo.com>and registered trademark (the “Trademark”) which had been registered in multiple jurisdictions including the Russian Federation, being the domicile of R.</lenovo.com></li>\n<li>\n			the Mark was a word created by C and had no literature meaning to it. R was not affiliated or authorised in any way with C to use the Trademark and R had no fair reason to use the Mark as the distinguishing part of the Disputed Domain Name.</li>\n<li>\n			the Disputed Domain Name was not in use. R’s passive holding of the Disputed Domain Name with the knowledge of C and C’s Trademarks and without having rights or legitimate interests in it constituted bad faith. C asserted that R’s purpose of cybersquatting the Disputed Domain Name was to obtain improper profits.</li>\n</ul><p>	<lenovo.com></lenovo.com></p>\n<p>\n		R did not file a formal Response using the designated response form, but sent an email to the ADNDRC within the required period of time for the Response, primarily asserting that:</p>\n<ul><li>\n			The Disputed Domain Name was available for registration and could be registered by anyone.</li>\n<li>\n			The Disputed Domain Name was a common word in several languages. R registered the Disputed Domain Name for non-commercial purpose and the registration was not a violation.</li>\n<li>\n			R did not know that the Mark was a registered trademark and had spent resources for the development of a non-commercial website.</li>\n</ul><p>\n		Nonetheless, R also indicated his readiness to transfer the Disputed Domain Name to C.</p>\n<p>\n		<strong>Held</strong>, granting the remedy sought, that:</p>\n<p>\n		The Panel was not persuaded by R that the Mark was a dictionary word. Conversely, the Panel found that the Mark was a fancy word with a high level of inherent distinctiveness which consumers associated exclusively with C, and it was identical to the Disputed Domain Name.</p>\n<p>\n		The Panel did not accept R’s argument that the Disputed Domain Name was available for registration and could be registered by anyone. As evident from the provision of the UDRP, the mere availability of a domain name for registration does not per se mean that it could be registered by anyone disregard of or in violation of the rights of third parties. In this case, the Trademark had been officially published in the Russian Federation, the domicile of R, and any person could check its status by accessing the official public database of the Russian Federal Institute of Industrial Property. Furthermore, R‘s readiness to transfer the Disputed Domain Name to C lead the Panel to infer that R implicitly accepted that it had no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name.</p>\n<p>\n		The Panel again did not accept R’s contention that even though it was not using the Disputed Domain Name, it had already started preparations to set up a non-commercial website under the Disputed Domain Name, for which R did not provide any details or evidence. Referring to <em>Telstra Corp.

attempt to sell or to contact the trademark holder does not as such prevent a finding of bad faith.</p>\n<p>\n		In accordance with para. 4(i) of the UDRP, the Panel granted the relief sought by

Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (&ldquo;ICANN&rdquo;) on 26 August 1999. The Respondent (hereinafter &ldquo;R&rdquo;) was the registrant of the Disputed Domain Name.</p>\n	<p>\n		In its email of 21 May 2015 to the Centre and in the Complainant, R asserted ownership of the disputed domain name. However, R failed to respond within the required period of time and its Response was deficient. Therefore, an important issue was whether the Panel had to consider the administratively late and deficient Response before dealing with the substantive issues.</p>\n	<p>\n		For late response, referring to the previous UDRP decisions in Young Genius Software AB v MWD, James Vargas (Case No. D2000-0591), the Panel agreed with that the lateness of R&rsquo;s response was de minimis and had not prejudiced the C nor had it delayed the Decision in this Administrative Proceeding. The Panel therefore admitted and considered the submission set out in the Response.</p>\n	<p>\n		For deficient response, referring to the Rule 5(b)(viii) and WIPO&rsquo;s UDRP decision in Talk City, Inc. v Robertson (Case No. D2000-0009), the Panel declined to treat it as a response because, among other things, the email did not contain the requisite certification that the information contained therein is, &ldquo;to the best of R&rsquo;s knowledge, complete and accurate&rdquo;.

Such power to revisit stemmed not from its original jurisdiction over the case, which had come to an end upon sealing (applying the principle of <em>functus officio</em>), but from a “fresh” power to act conferred on it by the statute.</li>\n<li>\n		Applying this principle, the Court was inclined to hold that it did have jurisdiction pursuant to the express power under O.3 r. 5 to extend time to bring P’s application to vary within time. However, under the rule of stare decisis, the Court was bound by the decision of the Court of First Instance in <em>RTX Products Hong Kong Ltd v Li Yiu Fai</em> and accordingly, it had no jurisdiction to revisit the Order once it was sealed. It became absolute when the judgment was perfected.</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:213:\"<p>Judgment – perfection rule – court’s jurisdiction to revisit previously perfected order – power to be exercised for specific limited purposes only which did not violate principle of functus officio</p>\n\";}}}s:11:\"field_court\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:14:\"District Court\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:14:\"District Court\";}}}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:2:\"en\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:28:\"Poon Ching Man v Lam Hoi Pun\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:28:\"Poon Ching Man v Lam Hoi Pun\";}}}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"474\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"103\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"612\";}}}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2015-08-01 07:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:18:\"field_citation_url\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:232:\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&src=rl&srguid=i0ad629030000014ed8b70b2a7460d12a&docguid=I9C37C474CABB4183B5DA81BB32FE6601&hitguid=I9C37C474CABB4183B5DA81BB32FE6601&spos=1&epos=1&td=5&crumb-action=append&context=13\";s:5:\"title\";s:17:\"[2015] 3 HKLRD 57\";s:10:\"attributes\";a:0:{}}}}s:15:\"field_case_date\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:13:\"22 April 2015\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:13:\"22 April 2015\";}}}s:18:\"field_case_subject\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:15:\"Civil Procedure\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:15:\"Civil Procedure\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:18:\"field_court_number\";a:0:{}s:12:\"field_judges\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:28:\"Poon Ching Man v Lam Hoi Pun\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:9:{s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1438819200\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458184717,1),('8756','O:8:\"stdClass\":41:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"8756\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:55:\"Beijing Tong Gang Da Sheng Trade Co Ltd v Allen & Overy\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"1\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"8756\";s:4:\"type\";s:12:\"case_updates\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1438819200\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1450252664\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"8756\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1450252664\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:4218:\"Maintenance and champerty – litigation funding agreement and assignment of cause of action – whether champertous<p>\n	Beijing Tong Gang Da Sheng Trade Co.

common in equal shares of a shop wherein P ran an electrical business. P claimed that he, D and their father, F, agreed that D would be registered as a co-owner only to secure repayment of a loan used to finance the purchase of the shop by P to F (the &ldquo;Loan&rdquo;); and once the Loan was fully repaid, D would remove his name; but despite the Loan being repaid and repeated demands, D had refused and/or failed to do so. P brought proceedings against D seeking a declaration that he was the sole beneficial owner of the shop and D held his half share in the shop on trust for P; and an order to compel D to transfer his half share to him.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, granting the declaration and order sought, that:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		As a matter of principle, there was no reason why the doctrine of &ldquo;common intention constructive trust&rdquo; could only be invoked in the &ldquo;domestic consumer context&rdquo;, although the context could be relevant in considering the parties&rsquo; common intention as to the beneficial ownership of a property purchased either in their joint names or in the sole name of one party. Rather, the presumption of equality applicable where members of the same family purchased in joint names a property which they intended to be and in fact was occupied by them as a home, would not apply outside the &ldquo;domestic consumer context&rdquo;.

P claimed that he, D and their father, F, agreed that D would be registered as a co-owner only to secure repayment of a loan used to finance the purchase of the shop by P to F (the “Loan”); and once the Loan was fully repaid, D would remove his name; but despite the Loan being repaid and repeated demands, D had refused and/or failed to do so.

On 6 March 2015, Ps obtained a warrant of arrest against the vessel &ldquo;Bo Shi Ji 838&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Arrest Vessel&rdquo;) on the basis of s. 12B(4) of the High Court Ordinance (Cap. 4) that C, being the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;, was its sole beneficial owner. After the Arrest Vessel was arrested on 18 March 2015, Ds provided to Ps, <em>inter alia</em>, the Vessel Ownership Registration Certificates (the &ldquo;VORCs&rdquo;) of: (a) the Claim Vessel, which showed that it had been co-owned by C (51 percent) and an individual X1 (49percent) since December 2010; and (b) the Arrest Vessel, which showed that it was solely owned by C between June2008 and September 2014. The VORCs were not formal documents from the shipping registry of Hui Zhou, which was not open for public inspection.

Ds submitted therefore that (a) only X1, and not C, was the &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; under s.12B(4)(b); and (b) the Arrest Vessel was not at the time of the Writ a sister ship of Claim Vessel for the purposes of s. 12B(4)(ii) because C was not the beneficial owner of all its shares.

the equity in P2. P2 was a PRC company which held a property development project (&ldquo;Project&rdquo;). D4 was the director of D1. P2, D1&ndash;2 entered into an agency agreement (the &ldquo;Agency Agreement&rdquo;) whereby among other things D1 advanced a sum of RMB120,330,603 to P2 and D2, to be repaid after the period stipulated. As security for the Agency Agreement, the following documents were executed, among others: (a) P1 mortgaged all his shares in D2 to D1; and (b) D2 pledged all its equity in P2 to D1. P2 and D2 failed to pay the amounts due to D1 under the Agency Agreement, and D1 obtained two default judgments against P2 &amp; D2, and P1 respectively. On the basis of the first default judgment, D1 obtained from a PRC court an order: (a) freezing the assets of P2 and D2 up to the amount owed; and (b) recognising and enforcing the first default judgment against them. D1 then exercised its rights under the mortgage and transferred P1&rsquo;s shareholding in D2 to itself. D1 then procured D2 to remove P1 as its director and appointed D3&ndash;4 in his place. As the new directors of D2, D3&ndash;4 passed written resolutions (&ldquo;Resolutions&rdquo;) appointing D4 as D2&rsquo;s authorised signatory. Thereafter, D4 signed several documents replacing the old management of P2 with D3 and D5&ndash;6. By an agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;), D2 (acting by D4) and P2 (acting by D3) agreed that P2 would perform certain obligations, including registering those changes and handing over its company chops and official documents, and the parties agreed to submit any dispute relating to the Agreement to arbitration in the PRC. D2 then commenced arbitration (the &ldquo;Arbitration&rdquo;) against P2 for failing to perform the Agreement. P1 sought an injunction against D1 to stop the Arbitration, alleging that D1 had breached its duty as mortgagee by (a) obtaining the default judgments and freezing the Project while negotiations were ongoing; (b) trying to take control of P2; and (c) using the Agreement and the Arbitration, which were both shams, to obtain an award to effect the change in management of P2.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, dismissing the application, that:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		There was nothing to show that an injunction against D1 would have the effect of putting a halt to the Arbitration, as it was not a party to the same. Equity did not act in vain and would not grant an injunction which was futile, thus the application should be dismissed <em>in limine</em>.</li>\n	<li>\n		Further, a late proposal to reformulate the application in an attempt to bind D2 was based on a misapprehension that as the sole shareholder of D2, D1 had the right the usurp the powers of D2&rsquo;s directors.</li>\n	<li>\n		As for the other points, first, there was no basis to suggest that the Arbitration was a sham. It was neither conducted in breach of an agreement, nor was D1&rsquo;s conduct unconscionable, vexatious or oppressive. The ends of justice did not require the Court to grant the anti-suit injunction, as the validity of the Agreement was an issue which would be determined by the tribunal in the Arbitration.</li>\n	<li>\n		Second, there was no dispute that P2 and D2 failed to pay the amounts due under the Agency Agreement. Therefore, D1 could exercise the powers under the mortgage on default. There was no breach of duty as the steps taken to seize control over P2 and D2 were within the powers given to D1 under the mortgage.</li>\n	<li>\n		Third, by the Resolutions, P2&rsquo;s old management was replaced by D3 and D5&ndash;6. The Agreement could not be a &ldquo;sham&rdquo; as the legal rights and obligations which the parties intended to create were exactly the same as those which it intended to portray to third parties.</li>\n	<li>\n		Fourth, there was nothing wrong in D1 taking enforcement steps while negotiating with P1 for a possible settlement. There was no implied duty for a party in negotiation to inform the other side of what legal steps he had taken or was going to take to enforce its rights.</li>\n	<li>\n		Finally, a creditor could choose to enforce whichever remedy was open to him. There was no basis for P1 to allege that D1&rsquo;s act in freezing the Project constituted a breach of duty.</li>\n</ul>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:200:\"Interlocutory anti-suit injunction restraining defendant from taking part in arbitration proceedings – defendant not party to arbitration – whether arbitration and underlying agreement “shams”\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:4912:\"<p>Interlocutory anti-suit injunction restraining defendant from taking part in arbitration proceedings – defendant not party to arbitration – whether arbitration and underlying agreement “shams”\n</p><p>\n	Chan Shu Chun v Right Margin Ltd</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&amp;src=rl&amp;srguid=i0ad8289e0000014f682455601543f6b5&amp;docguid=I4200B66F3FAD4015A649EEC57907603C&amp;hitguid=I4200B66F3FAD4015A649EEC57907603C&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;td=13&amp;crumb-action=append&amp;context=14\">[2015] HKEC 1058</a><br />\n	Court of First Instance<br />\n	High Court Action No. 792 of 2015<br />\n	Recorder Linda Chan SC<br />\n	13 May 2015</p>\n<p>\n	P1 was the sole shareholder of D2, which owned all the equity in P2.

Equity did not act in vain and would not grant an injunction which was futile, thus the application should be dismissed <em>in limine</em>.</li>\n<li>\n		Further, a late proposal to reformulate the application in an attempt to bind D2 was based on a misapprehension that as the sole shareholder of D2, D1 had the right the usurp the powers of D2’s directors.</li>\n<li>\n		As for the other points, first, there was no basis to suggest that the Arbitration was a sham. It was neither conducted in breach of an agreement, nor was D1’s conduct unconscionable, vexatious or oppressive. The ends of justice did not require the Court to grant the anti-suit injunction, as the validity of the Agreement was an issue which would be determined by the tribunal in the Arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n		Second, there was no dispute that P2 and D2 failed to pay the amounts due under the Agency Agreement. Therefore, D1 could exercise the powers under the mortgage on default. There was no breach of duty as the steps taken to seize control over P2 and D2 were within the powers given to D1 under the mortgage.</li>\n<li>\n		Third, by the Resolutions, P2’s old management was replaced by D3 and D5–6. The Agreement could not be a “sham” as the legal rights and obligations which the parties intended to create were exactly the same as those which it intended to portray to third parties.</li>\n<li>\n		Fourth, there was nothing wrong in D1 taking enforcement steps while negotiating with P1 for a possible settlement. There was no implied duty for a party in negotiation to inform the other side of what legal steps he had taken or was going to take to enforce its rights.</li>\n<li>\n		Finally, a creditor could choose to enforce whichever remedy was open to him. There was no basis for P1 to allege that D1’s act in freezing the Project constituted a breach of duty.</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:208:\"<p>Interlocutory anti-suit injunction restraining

Further, that S contributed to the purchase by effectively guaranteeing with his personal liability his parents’ liability under the mortgage, was entirely consistent with adult children in Hong Kong assisting their parents out of filial obligation. This did not detract in any way from the parties’ common intention.</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:90:\"<p>Constructive trust – common intention constructive trust – whether established</p>\n\";}}}s:11:\"field_court\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:23:\"Court of First Instance\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:23:\"Court of First Instance\";}}}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:2:\"en\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:28:\"Yip Yuk Kwong v Yip Chun Yin\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:28:\"Yip Yuk Kwong v Yip Chun Yin\";}}}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"474\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"112\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"612\";}}}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2015-09-01 07:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:18:\"field_citation_url\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:231:\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&src=rl&srguid=i0ad82d080000014f9762fd2f78396342&docguid=I9F7393E7B5E1429296C78E62DCBF0C54&hitguid=I9F7393E7B5E1429296C78E62DCBF0C54&spos=1&epos=1&td=1&crumb-action=append&context=4\";s:5:\"title\";s:16:\"[2015] HKEC 1312\";s:10:\"attributes\";a:0:{}}}}s:15:\"field_case_date\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:11:\"3 July 2015\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:11:\"3 July 2015\";}}}s:18:\"field_case_subject\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:8:\"Land Law\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:8:\"Land Law\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:18:\"field_court_number\";a:0:{}s:12:\"field_judges\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:28:\"Yip Yuk Kwong v Yip Chun Yin\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:9:{s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1441324800\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458184717,1),('8774','O:8:\"stdClass\":41:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"8774\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:48:\"Town Planning Board v Town Planning Appeal Board\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"8774\";s:4:\"type\";s:12:\"case_updates\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1441324800\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1450249307\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"8774\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1450249307\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:3197:\"Decision on compliance of conditions under planning permission not “decision” of Board under s. 16 – not reviewable under s. 17<p>\n	Town Planning Board v Town Planning Appeal Board</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&amp;src=rl&amp;srguid=ia744d0640000014f682773f60af72ef3&amp;docguid=I83C6BDB9D7B745239BEECC58F7926C78&amp;hitguid=I83C6BDB9D7B745239BEECC58F7926C78&amp;spos=8&amp;epos=8&amp;td=378&amp;crumb-action=append&amp;context=25\">[2015] HKEC 1151</a><br />\n	Court of Appeal<br />\n	Civil Appeal No. 25 of 2014<br />\n	Lam V-P, Kwan JA and Jeremy Poon J<br />\n	18 June 2015</p>\n<p>\n	Xs applied to the Town Planning Board (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) for planning permission for a proposed development scheme, which was eventually granted by the Town Planning Appeal Board (the &ldquo;Appeal Board&rdquo;) subject to conditions.

href=\"http://www.adndrc.org/diymodule/docUDRP/HK-1500751_Decision.pdf\">HK – 1500751</a> \"Chinatimber.org\"<br />\r\nAsian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (Hong Kong Office)<br />\r\nLoke-Khoon Tan (Panelist)<br />\r\n23 June 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 15 April 2015, Complainant (hereinafter “C”) initiated a domain name dispute resolution proceeding concerning <chinatimber.org>(the “Disputed Domain Name”) under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the “Policy”) by filing a complaint with the Hong Kong Office of Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (the “Centre”). Respondent (hereinafter “R”) was recorded as the Registrant of the Disputed Domain Name in accordance with the Whois information.</chinatimber.org></p>\r\n\r\n<p><chinatimber.org> </chinatimber.org></p>\r\n\r\n<p>C alleged that C was the original registrant of the Disputed Domain Name and operated an online timber trading platform via a website resolved by the Disputed Domain Name, and there were more than 150,000 registered users of the platform. C provided with documentary proofs, evidencing that it held the registration of the Disputed Domain Name from 5 May 2009 till November 2014 when C found the Disputed Domain Name having been transferred to R without its authorisation and permission. The Registrar (domain name registration service provider) had also been changed from the Xinnet to eNom. Although the Disputed Domain Name was still resolved to C’s website, C suffered from losing the control of the Disputed Domain Name and its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Complaint, C contended that the Disputed Domain Name was identical to its mark (<strong>“中国木材网 / www.chinatimber.org”</strong>) (the “Mark”), and that R, who had no rights and legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name, had registered and was using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after the Centre’s notification of commencement of proceedings to R, C reported that its website had been shut down by R, and then filed a supplemental submission that R’s suspension of C’s website also constituted using the domain name in bad faith under the UDRP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R failed to file any response within the required period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, granting the remedy sought, that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A threshold issue before the Panel was whether C had rights to the Mark which was not a registered mark. The Panel accepted the view set out by para. 1.7 of the WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Second Edition and recent ADNDRC decisions under HK-1500709 and HK-1400614, that to successfully assert common law or unregistered trademark rights, a complainant must show that the name had become a distinctive identifier associated with the complainant or its goods or services. In view of the fact that C had used and promoted the Mark in its online platform since 2009, and that many search results of the Mark in a major engine pointed to C, the Panel accepted that C had rights to the Mark which had been a distinctive identifier of C. Further, the Panel found that the Disputed Domain Name was identical and confusingly similar to C’s Mark.</li>\r\n	<li>The Panel also found that R had no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name.

Respondent (hereinafter “R”) was recorded as the Registrant of the Disputed Domain Name in accordance with the Whois information.</chinatimber.org></p>\n<p><chinatimber.org></chinatimber.org></p>\n<p>C alleged that C was the original registrant of the Disputed Domain Name and operated an online timber trading platform via a website resolved by the Disputed Domain Name, and there were more than 150,000 registered users of the platform. C provided with documentary proofs, evidencing that it held the registration of the Disputed Domain Name from 5 May 2009 till November 2014 when C found the Disputed Domain Name having been transferred to R without its authorisation and permission. The Registrar (domain name registration service provider) had also been changed from the Xinnet to eNom. Although the Disputed Domain Name was still resolved to C’s website, C suffered from losing the control of the Disputed Domain Name and its website.</p>\n<p>In the Complaint, C contended that the Disputed Domain Name was identical to its mark (<strong>“中国木材网 / <a href=\"http://www.chinatimber.org\">www.chinatimber.org</a>”</strong>) (the “Mark”), and that R, who had no rights and legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name, had registered and was using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Centre’s notification of commencement of proceedings to R, C reported that its website had been shut down by R, and then filed a supplemental submission that R’s suspension of C’s website also constituted using the domain name in bad faith under the UDRP.</p>\n<p>R failed to file any response within the required period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, granting the remedy sought, that:</p>\n<ul><li>A threshold issue before the Panel was whether C had rights to the Mark which was not a registered mark. The Panel accepted the view set out by para. 1.7 of the WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Second Edition and recent ADNDRC decisions under HK-1500709 and HK-1400614, that to successfully assert common law or unregistered trademark rights, a complainant must show that the name had become a distinctive identifier associated with the complainant or its goods or services. In view of the fact that C had used and promoted the Mark in its online platform since 2009, and that many search results of the Mark in a major engine pointed to C, the Panel accepted that C had rights to the Mark which had been a distinctive identifier of C. Further, the Panel found that the Disputed Domain Name was identical and confusingly similar to C’s Mark.</li>\n<li>The Panel also found that R had no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name. Based on the fact that the Disputed Domain Name was resolving to C’s website before and after R’s attainment of the Disputed Domain Name, the Panel inferred that R must have known about C’s Mark. R’s suspension of the Disputed Domain Name’s resolution after receipt of the Centre’s notice of complaint, which resulted in the shutting down of C’s website, had disrupted C’s business and caused losses to C. In the absence of response from R, the Panel accepted C’s submission that C was the original holder of the Disputed Domain Name which had been transferred to and registered by R without C’s permission.</li>\n</ul><p>Having found that R had registered and was using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith, the Panel ordered that the Disputed Domain Name be transferred to

The Adjudicator found that the only issue was whether a quorum was present at two general meetings of the owners; that this was governed by the terms of the deed of mutual covenant which provided that a quorum was 75 percent of the owners; and so the requisite quorum was lacking and the resolution passed at the meetings was not valid. The IO appealed under s. 28 of the Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance (Cap. 338).</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, allowing the appeal and remitting the case to the Tribunal for retrial before another adjudicator, that:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		Under s. 34C of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (the &ldquo;BMO&rdquo;), that part of the BMO relating to deeds of mutual covenant shall prevail over any inconsistent terms of a deed of mutual covenant.

The Adjudicator found that the only issue was whether a quorum was present at two general meetings of the owners; that this was governed by the terms of the deed of mutual covenant which provided that a quorum was 75 percent of the owners; and so the requisite quorum was lacking and the resolution passed at the meetings was not valid. The IO appealed under s. 28 of the Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance (Cap. 338).</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Held</strong>, allowing the appeal and remitting the case to the Tribunal for retrial before another adjudicator, that:</p>\n<ul><li>\n		Under s. 34C of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (the “BMO”), that part of the BMO relating to deeds of mutual covenant shall prevail over any inconsistent terms of a deed of mutual covenant.

The Adjudicator did not correctly consider Sch.3 or the definition of “a resolution of the owners” provided in s. 34D(3) and thereby erred in law.</li>\n<li>\n		As the matters at issue in the trial

The prominent and distinctive part of the Disputed Domain Name &ldquo;wynn&rdquo; was identical to C&rsquo;s Mark and the new gTLD &ldquo;.tokyo&rdquo; placed after the Mark gave a strong visual similarity to other domain names registered by C like <wynnlasvegas.com>.</wynnlasvegas.com></li>\n		<li>\n			C and its Group companies had not authorised or otherwise permitted R to use the Mark or any other name/mark of C&rsquo;s Group. The Disputed Domain Name was resolved to a parking page which gave no connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services.

P engaged D2 to supply machinery and operators for the works. The works did not progress at the rate anticipated and D1 considered terminating P&rsquo;s subcontract.

D1 terminated the subcontract and P commenced proceedings against Ds, claiming that the key concepts of the Method were the use of a wedge as a jamming and immobilising device between the pile and the internal surface of a steel casing; and the trapping of the pile inside the casing, which rotated causing the pile to twist and to break at a predetermined point. P contended that D1 used the Method to continue with the works at the site without P&rsquo;s permission and D2 participated in such infringement. The Judge dismissed P&rsquo;s claims, holding that the specification of the Patent did not disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art; and alternatively, the Method had been made available to the public and was not new.

In any event, the Judge was right in rejecting such contention. To establish accessory liability in tort, a defendant must have acted in a way which furthered the commission of the tort by another pursuant to a common design to do or secure the doing of the acts which constituted the tort. The required limitation on the scope of liability, founded on a pragmatic concern to limit the propensity of the law of tort to interfere with a person&rsquo;s right to things which were in themselves entirely lawful, was achieved by the combination of active cooperation and commonality of intention. D2 was a supplier of equipment and operators. There was no evidence that D2 knew the equipment and operators were being used to commit an infringement of the Patent or that D1 was infringing the Patent.

Traces of ketamine were found on an electronic scale and two spoons inside two boxes which PW1 was carrying and one of three rubbish bags which D was holding. T was carrying a box containing eights packets of ketamine and a bag containing 23 packets of ketamine. Police seized a thermosealer from the flat. Traces of ketamine were found on the three men’s hands, but none on D’s fingernails. D, PW1 and T were charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug. PW1 pleaded guilty and gave evidence against D as a prosecution witness, stating that he had no previous experience of drugs or trafficking, he had been solicited by D and T to participate in the trafficking and let them use his flat to pack the drugs in exchange for money. D testified that he went to PW1’s home, played computer games and then went to sleep.

of theft. X pleaded guilty while D was convicted after trial. The prosecution relied mainly on CCTV footage which showed D and X entering a McDonald’s restaurant together and sitting at the Entrance Table. D left his rucksack with X and went to the toilet, passing V seated at the Middle Table in a corridor. After leaving the toilet, all three corridor tables were unoccupied. D picked up V’s iPhone (the “iPhone”) from the Middle Table and returned to X at the Entrance Table. D showed the iPhone to X, they conversed, D put the iPhone in his bag and immediately left with X. On arrest and in court, D claimed that he took the iPhone because he thought it belonged to X. D testified that the iPhone was the same brand as X’s; she had a habit of leaving her belongings behind; she might have gone to the toilet and left her mobile telephone on the table; and when he asked X if the iPhone was hers, she said, “Yes” and put it in her handbag. In cross-examining D and in closing submissions, the prosecution seemingly suggested that it was sufficient to prove that D alone committed the offence. After the Deputy Magistrate repeatedly emphasised that D faced a joint charge, the prosecution submitted that when D took the iPhone and showed it to X, it became a “joint venture” between them and they treated the iPhone as their own. D appealed against conviction arguing that the Deputy Magistrate erred in: (a) holding that the only reasonable and irresistible inference was that “at all material time” both D and X knew the iPhone belonged to a third party and shared a common intention to steal it; and (b) rejecting D’s explanation, <em>inter alia</em>, on the basis that it was incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, dismissing the appeal, that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>At the present hearing, the prosecution drew the Court’s attention to the CCTV footage which showed that when D returned to X, she was speaking on a mobile telephone and, contrary to D’s testimony and the Deputy Magistrate’s finding, D placed the iPhone in his own bag and left with X. While an appeal court was entitled to take into account all the evidence adduced at trial, D was not cross-examined as to his state of mind when he saw X speaking on another mobile telephone. Accordingly, the Court was not in a proper position to assess the weight to be attached to such evidence or consider its effect on the case.</li>\r\n	<li>On all the evidence, in particular the CCTV footage, the Deputy Magistrate’s rejection of the exculpatory part of D’s testimony should not be disturbed. Notwithstanding that the Court had concerns about the Deputy Magistrate’s view on alleged discrepancies mentioned by him, his decision was not flawed. D’s claimed belief was unreasonable.</li>\r\n	<li>Further, it was clear the Deputy Magistrate knew throughout that the charge was a joint one and after repeatedly reminding the prosecution of this, the prosecution then put to D an allegation which sat well with the charge. There was nothing to indicate that the defence was misled or prejudiced, or that the Deputy Magistrate’s decision did not concern whether the offence was jointly committed with X.</li>\r\n	<li>While the prosecution had clarified the timing of the “joint venture”, its exact basis, in particular the role and mens rea of D and X, was less than clear. This case should be decided by reference to s. 4(1) of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210). There was no reason to think the Deputy Magistrate had not done so. Reading his statement of findings in context, in saying that a joint intent was formed “at all material time”, he must have meant it was formed when the couple met again after D had picked up the iPhone. This was the only time it was possible for D and X to have jointly dishonestly appropriated the iPhone in the restaurant knowing it belonged to someone else and shared a common intention to permanently deprive the owner of it.</li>\r\n	<li>On the whole of the evidence, and given the rejection of the exculpatory part of D’s testimony, the Deputy Magistrate properly drew the only and irresistible inference that when D rejoined X, he decided to assume the rights as owner of the iPhone and stole it jointly with X.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:172:\"<p>Theft – joint charge – inference of common design – whether only reasonable and irresistible inference to be drawn – whether requisite mens rea established</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:4954:\"<p>Theft – joint charge – inference of common design – whether only reasonable and irresistible inference to be drawn – whether requisite mens rea established</p>\n<p>HKSAR v Lau Chun Pong</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/search/run?ao=o.I05F65DF0BB8E44E2958F911CF8D0E23D&amp;srguid=&amp;context=15&amp;crumb-action=append&amp;crumb-label=Search+Results&amp;ntocview=I05F65DF0BB8E44E2958F911CF8D0E23D&amp;frt=hksar+v+lau+chun+pong&amp;pty=&amp;cit=&amp;snippets=true&amp;buttonSearch=Search\">[2015] 4 HKLRD 583</a><br />\nCourt of First Instance<br />\nMagistracy Appeal No. 633 of 2013<br />\nAlbert Wong J<br />\n10 August 2015</p>\n<p>D was jointly charged with X, his girlfriend, of theft.

Accordingly, the Court was not in a proper position to assess the weight to be attached to such evidence or consider its effect on the case.</li>\n<li>On all the evidence, in particular the CCTV footage, the Deputy Magistrate’s rejection of the exculpatory part of D’s testimony should not be disturbed. Notwithstanding that the Court had concerns about the Deputy Magistrate’s view on alleged discrepancies mentioned by him, his decision was not flawed. D’s claimed belief was unreasonable.</li>\n<li>Further, it was clear the Deputy Magistrate knew throughout that the charge was a joint one and after repeatedly reminding the prosecution of this, the prosecution then put to D an allegation which sat well with the charge. There was nothing to indicate that the defence was misled or prejudiced, or that the Deputy Magistrate’s decision did not concern whether the offence was jointly committed with X.</li>\n<li>While the prosecution had clarified the timing of the “joint venture”, its exact basis, in particular the role and mens rea of D and X, was less than clear. This case should be decided by reference to s. 4(1) of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210). There was no reason to think the Deputy Magistrate had not done so. Reading his statement of findings in context, in saying that a joint intent was formed “at all material time”, he must have meant it was formed when the couple met again after D had picked up the iPhone. This was the only time it was possible for D and X to have jointly dishonestly appropriated the iPhone in the restaurant knowing it belonged to someone else and shared a common intention to permanently deprive the owner of it.</li>\n<li>On the whole of the evidence, and given the rejection of the exculpatory part of D’s testimony, the Deputy Magistrate properly drew the only and irresistible inference that when D rejoined X, he decided to assume the rights as owner of the iPhone and stole it jointly with X.</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:171:\"<p>Theft – joint charge –

claimed against D, the incorporated owners, for various reliefs. D’s defence and counterclaim (the “Counterclaim”) alleged that P or previous owners had erected unauthorised building works (“UBWs”) in the flat contrary to the deed of mutual covenant (the “DMC”). The Counterclaim sought, <em>inter alia</em>, an injunction against P to remove the UBWs and to restore the flat to its previous condition. D registered the Counterclaim as a <em>lis pendens</em> against the flat. P took steps to remove the UBWs and applied for an order to vacate the Counterclaim from the Land Registry. D claimed that the removal works were incomplete and refused to do so. Before the hearing of P’s application, P sold the flat to a third party. The Master then dismissed P’s application. P appealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, allowing the appeal:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If the Counterclaim were a claim <em>in personam</em>, as D now accepted, the judgment that it might establish would not bind a subsequent bona fide purchaser or mortgagee. Thus, there was no reason why it should be allowed to be registered. <em>Res judicata</em> did not apply as between D and a subsequent <em>bona fide</em> purchaser or mortgagee of the flat. The judgment was also not a matter of title although it might be evidence of a breach by the existing owner of the DMC. What bound the subsequent purchaser or mortgagee was the DMC which had been registered. Even if the Counterclaim was not registered as a <em>lis pendens</em>, no <em>bona fide</em> purchaser or mortgagee of the flat could obtain a title to it free of the DMC. It was for the subsequent purchaser or mortgagee to be satisfied of any breach of the DMC before completion. If the owners had covered up such breaches when conveying the premises to the purchaser, then the purchaser could resort to contractual remedies against the previous owner.</li>\r\n	<li>As for the issue of notice, pursuant to s. 4 of the LRO, if a judgment (or <em>lis pendens</em>) was not registered, then even if the subsequent purchaser had actual notice of it, the assignment of the subsequent purchaser would still have a higher priority over it. If the importance of the registration lay in the giving of notice of a claim to the subsequent purchaser and the claim was not for any proprietary interest in or charge on the property, then there was no reason to limit the mode of giving notice only to registration at the Land Registry and to compel such registration with the sanction of listing priority. There were many ways of giving notice of an infringement of the DMC to a potential purchaser. Hence, s. 4 should not be for compelling registration for such purposes, but to compel registration of a judgment (or lis pendens) that claimed an interest in or charge on the property in question.

D’s defence and counterclaim (the “Counterclaim”) alleged that P or previous owners had erected unauthorised building works (“UBWs”) in the flat contrary to the deed of mutual covenant (the “DMC”). The Counterclaim sought, <em>inter alia</em>, an injunction against P to remove the UBWs and to restore the flat to its previous condition. D registered the Counterclaim as a <em>lis pendens</em> against the flat. P took steps to remove the UBWs and applied for an order to vacate the Counterclaim from the Land Registry. D claimed that the removal works were incomplete and refused to do so. Before the hearing of P’s application, P sold the flat to a third party. The Master then dismissed P’s application. P appealed.</p>\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, allowing the appeal:</p>\n<ul><li>If the Counterclaim were a claim <em>in personam</em>, as D now accepted, the judgment that it might establish would not bind a subsequent bona fide purchaser or mortgagee. Thus, there was no reason why it should be allowed to be registered. <em>Res judicata</em> did not apply as between D and a subsequent <em>bona fide</em> purchaser or mortgagee of the flat. The judgment was also not a matter of title although it might be evidence of a breach by the existing owner of the DMC. What bound the subsequent purchaser or mortgagee was the DMC which had been registered. Even if the Counterclaim was not registered as a <em>lis pendens</em>, no <em>bona fide</em> purchaser or mortgagee of the flat could obtain a title to it free of the DMC. It was for the subsequent purchaser or mortgagee to be satisfied of any breach of the DMC before completion. If the owners had covered up such breaches when conveying the premises to the purchaser, then the purchaser could resort to contractual remedies against the previous owner.</li>\n<li>As for the issue of notice, pursuant to s. 4 of the LRO, if a judgment (or <em>lis pendens</em>) was not registered, then even if the subsequent purchaser had actual notice of it, the assignment of the subsequent purchaser would still have a higher priority over it. If the importance of the registration lay in the giving of notice of a claim to the subsequent purchaser and the claim was not for any proprietary interest in or charge on the property, then there was no reason to limit the mode of giving notice only to registration at the Land Registry and to compel such registration with the sanction of listing priority. There were many ways of giving notice of an infringement of the DMC to a potential purchaser. Hence, s. 4 should not be for compelling registration for such purposes, but to compel registration of a judgment (or lis pendens) that claimed an interest in or charge on the property in question. This would facilitate the tracing and ascertaining of title.</li>\n<li>These and other provisions of the LRO, namely, ss. 2, 3(2), 5, 5A, 14, 16 and 17, provided for and regulated the registration of a lis pendens which claimed a proprietary interest or right in a real property.

The email was copied to the CNNIC and the HKIAC requested that the CNNIC keep the above disputed Domain Name locked until the proceeding was finalised. On the same day, the Registrar acknowledged the email notification but informed the HKIAC that the Prior Registrant was no longer the registrant/holder of the Domain Name. Shortly after the Registrar’s acknowledgment, the Respondent (hereinafter “R”) contacted the HKIAC by email, and requested all the documents be submitted in Chinese because he did not understand English. The HKIAC noted that the disputed Domain Name Registrant was transferred from the Prior Registrant to R within approximately 30 minutes of the New Case Notification sent to the Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon being informed by the HKIAC of the administrative deficiencies of the Complaint, C duly filed the amended Complaint in English naming R and further requesting that the proceedings be conducted in English, with reasons for such request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Complaint, C contended that the Disputed Domain Name was identical to the trademark consisting in the wording Synjardy® owned by C in several countries, especially China. C is also the owner of an important domain names portfolio including the trademark SYNJARDY®. Further, C contended that R had no rights and legitimate interests in respective of the Disputed Domain Name and had registered and was using the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R failed to file any response within the required period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, granting the remedy sought, that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Having considered the overarching objectives of the Policy in terms of efficiency and economy and concerns on procedural fairness, the Panel is of the opinion that it is fair and just to conduct the proceedings in the dual-language of English and Chinese. The special circumstances of this case which were taken into account included the fact that C is located in Germany with no knowledge of Chinese. In order to carry out the proceedings in Chinese, C would have to retain specialised translation services at a cost likely to be higher than the cost of these proceedings. Furthermore, there was evidence that R had replied to C’s cease-and-desist letter in English and R’s default signature was in English in all his email communications to the HKIAC. The Panel believes that this would have been a sufficient basis that R is able to read and understand English, at least in the context of domain name disputes.

Personal Data requiring that Mr. Webb remove from his website (webb-site.com) the names of parties set out in court judgments of matrimonial proceedings published on the Hong Kong Judiciary&rsquo;s website over a decade earlier.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>\n	David Webb is a former investment banker turned activist who runs a website offering information on corporate and economic governance in Hong Kong, including the various roles that particular individuals play in the financial and public sectors.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>The Decision</strong></p>\n<p>\n	The AAB confirmed that Mr. Webb had contravened Data Protection Principle 3 (&ldquo;DPP3&rdquo;) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) by continuing to publish hyperlinks on webb-site.com to

the purpose at the time that the data was collected, or a directly related purpose.</p>\n<p>\n	The AAB held that DPP3 is directed against the misuse of personal data, regardless of whether the relevant personal data has been published elsewhere or was in the public domain.</p>\n<p>\n	The AAB considered that &ldquo;the purpose for which the data was to be used at the time of the collection of the data&rdquo; was to enable the Judiciary&rsquo;s judgments to be utilised as &ldquo;legal precedents on points of law, practice and procedure of the courts and of public interests&rdquo; and not to identify the parties in the judgments. Mr. Webb&rsquo;s purpose as a data user (held to be &ldquo;reporting and publication for general use&rdquo;) amounted to a new purpose inconsistent with that for which the personal data was collected, in contravention of DPP3.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Balance between Freedom of Expression and Personal Data Privacy</strong></p>\n<p>\n	The AAB determined that the balance between freedom of expression and data privacy protection struck by the Commissioner in its enforcement notice was not unreasonable.

Just as importantly, claimants will need to establish and quantify their loss.</p>\n<hr /><p>\n	* <em>“If we [the intermediary] solicit the sale of or recommend any financial product to you [the client], the financial product must be reasonably suitable for you having regard to your financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives.

Amongst the issues being considered include whether the G20 remit of mandatory reporting and clearing has achieved its intended purpose.<br />\n	<br />\n	At the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009, the G20 agreed that all standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate; cleared through central counterparties to reduce counterparty risk; and reported to trade repositories to increase transparency. Non-centrally cleared derivatives should be subject to higher capital requirements.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>New Issues on OTC Derivatives Reforms<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	David Wright, secretary-general of IOSCO, said that although considerable progress had been made on the derivatives market reform &ndash; for example, the majority of interest rate swaps are being cleared through CCPs, and OTC derivatives are becoming subject to higher capital requirements &ndash; much remained to be done.<br />\n	<br />\n	&quot;By and large, the ship has been steadied. That&#39;s not to say the job is done. There are new risks emerging and regulators still have significant challenges before them.&quot;<br />\n	<br />\n	The robustness of CCPs is another area that is now under intensive examination, according to Wright. He said the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (&ldquo;CPMI&rdquo;) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions&#39; standards for CCPs are working closely together on analysing the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (&ldquo;PFMI&rdquo;) under different conditions.<br />\n	<br />\n	Some of the PFMI requirements relate to the financial risk management practices of CCPs regarding governance, stress-testing, margin, liquidity, collateral and recovery. Other areas that are now being examined include whether the default mechanism is able to deal appropriately with a default situation and whether CCPs have sufficient capital should a counterparty fail.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Lack of Data Harmonization<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	The mandatory trade reporting of OTC derivatives trade data which was intended to increase transparency might not have achieved its intended purpose. Wright said what started off as a simple idea of having globally aggregated trade data, particularly on derivatives, has regrettably burgeoned into 29 trade repositories worldwide. He said this has presented a different set of challenges, including the difficulty in harmonising and aggregating trade data, which has made it difficult for regulators to have a full picture of trading pattern. Regulators worldwide are now working on harmonising data based on products and transaction pattern.<br />\n	<br />\n	&quot;Regulators are working on common data standards but this is going to take some time,&rdquo; he said.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Mandatory Clearing<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	Despite the new issues that have emerged, the main financial centres in the Asia-Pacific region, namely Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, are pressing ahead with their respective OTC derivatives reforms. Hong Kong and Singapore began voluntary clearing of OTC derivatives trades at the end of 2014, and mandatory clearing in those two jurisdictions is expected to go into full swing this year, said Kishore Ramakrishnan, director, consulting at PwC in Hong Kong.<br />\n	<br />\n	Ramakrishnan said Singapore is likely to begin mandatory clearing of certain derivatives products, mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange products and non-deliverable forwards, during the second and third quarters of this year. He said Hong Kong was widely expected to enforce mandatory clearing in the third quarter after it has gone through the legislative process in the first quarter of 2016.<br />\n	<br />\n	Ramakrishnan said most jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific region will begin with interbank clearing, whereas buy-side clearing, which applies to derivatives users such as assets managers, hedge funds, insurance firms and corporates, is not expected to happen until 2017.<br />\n	<br />\n	&quot;In fact, buy-side clearing may not take place until 2018, largely because of the lack of liquidity for some derivatives products,&quot; he said. <br />\n	<br />\n	As banks operating in the OTC derivatives markets work toward compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, both of which have been slated for implementation in 2018, preparation work is now underway. <br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Trades<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	The implementation of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared trades is set to take place on 1 September 2016, and more Asian jurisdictions will publish their respective consultation papers in the first quarter of this year. Ramakrishnan said he expected to see Japan and Singapore finalise their rules in the first quarter, while Hong Kong could be next, following the release of its consultation paper in December 2015.<br />\n	<br />\n	The fact that Asian jurisdictions are all at such different stages of progress in terms of their rule-making has made it much harder for financial institutions to prepare for rule implementation.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Substituted Compliance and Risk Mitigation<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	Tom Jenkins, partner at KPMG China, said that if regulators were able to finalise the substituted compliance determination before the 1 September 2016 implementation date, it would reduce the complex tasks that financial institutions need to do.<br />\n	<br />\n	Jenkins said regulators are likely to expect banks which enter into non-centrally cleared derivatives with covered entities to comply with risk mitigation requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for instance, proposed such requirements in its December consultation paper. These risk mitigation requirements cover areas such as trading relationship documentation and trade confirmation. Banks would be required to examine their policy processes to ensure that they meet these requirements, Jenkins said.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Netting<br />\n	</strong><br />\n	The netting concept, which falls under the banner of margin requirements for bilateral trades, will be one of the main concerns for market participants this year, according to Jenkins. Under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#39;s framework, banks are allowed to net off contracts that are profitable against those which are in loss-making positions. Regulations in the European Union and the United States allow netting to apply only if there is a valid netting agreement in place. <br />\n	<br />\n	In Asia, where many jurisdictions have no valid netting opinions, netting becomes an issue, Jenkins said. &quot;If your counterparty is in a jurisdiction with no netting opinions, margin will be calculated on a gross basis, which is likely to be higher,&quot; he said.<br />\n	<br />\n	Jenkins said the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are considering whether to introduce a threshold on transactions with counterparties in non-netting jurisdictions.<br />\n	&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:37:\"Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:7158:\"<p>Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence\n</p><p>\n	The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) is now looking at a number of new issues and risks that have emerged in the over-the-counter derivatives markets following six years of reforms.

Wright said what started off as a simple idea of having globally aggregated trade data, particularly on derivatives, has regrettably burgeoned into 29 trade repositories worldwide. He said this has presented a different set of challenges, including the difficulty in harmonising and aggregating trade data, which has made it difficult for regulators to have a full picture of trading pattern. Regulators worldwide are now working on harmonising data based on products and transaction pattern.</p>\n<p>	\"Regulators are working on common data standards but this is going to take some time,” he said.</p>\n<p>	<strong>Mandatory Clearing<br /></strong><br />\n	Despite the new issues that have emerged, the main financial centres in the Asia-Pacific region, namely Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, are pressing ahead with their respective OTC derivatives reforms. Hong Kong and Singapore began voluntary clearing of OTC derivatives trades at the end of 2014, and mandatory clearing in those two jurisdictions is expected to go into full swing this year, said Kishore Ramakrishnan, director, consulting at PwC in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>	Ramakrishnan said Singapore is likely to begin mandatory clearing of certain derivatives products, mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange products and non-deliverable forwards, during the second and third quarters of this year. He said Hong Kong was widely expected to enforce mandatory clearing in the third quarter after it has gone through the legislative process in the first quarter of 2016.</p>\n<p>	Ramakrishnan said most jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific region will begin with interbank clearing, whereas buy-side clearing, which applies to derivatives users such as assets managers, hedge funds, insurance firms and corporates, is not expected to happen until 2017.</p>\n<p>	\"In fact, buy-side clearing may not take place until 2018, largely because of the lack of liquidity for some derivatives products,\" he said. </p>\n<p>	As banks operating in the OTC derivatives markets work toward compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, both of which have been slated for implementation in 2018, preparation work is now underway. </p>\n<p>	<strong>Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Trades<br /></strong><br />\n	The implementation of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared trades is set to take place on 1 September 2016, and more Asian jurisdictions will publish their respective consultation papers in the first quarter of this year. Ramakrishnan said he expected to see Japan and Singapore finalise their rules in the first quarter, while Hong Kong could be next, following the release of its consultation paper in December 2015.</p>\n<p>	The fact that Asian jurisdictions are all at such different stages of progress in terms of their rule-making has made it much harder for financial institutions to prepare for rule implementation.</p>\n<p>	<strong>Substituted Compliance and Risk Mitigation<br /></strong><br />\n	Tom Jenkins, partner at KPMG China, said that if regulators were able to finalise the substituted compliance determination before the 1 September 2016 implementation date, it would reduce the complex tasks that financial institutions need to do.</p>\n<p>	Jenkins said regulators are likely to expect banks which enter into non-centrally cleared derivatives with covered entities to comply with risk mitigation requirements. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for instance, proposed such requirements in its December consultation paper. These risk mitigation requirements cover areas such as trading relationship documentation and trade confirmation. Banks would be required to examine their policy processes to ensure that they meet these requirements, Jenkins said.</p>\n<p>	<strong>Netting<br /></strong><br />\n	The netting concept, which falls under the banner of margin requirements for bilateral trades, will be one of the main concerns for market participants this year, according to Jenkins. Under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\'s framework, banks are allowed to net off contracts that are profitable against those which are in loss-making positions. Regulations in the European Union and the United States allow netting to apply only if there is a valid netting agreement in place. </p>\n<p>	In Asia, where many jurisdictions have no valid netting opinions, netting becomes an issue, Jenkins said. \"If your counterparty is in a jurisdiction with no netting opinions, margin will be calculated on a gross basis, which is likely to be higher,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	Jenkins said the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are considering whether to introduce a threshold on transactions with counterparties in non-netting jurisdictions.<br />\n	 </p>\n\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:45:\"<p>Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\n\";}}}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_image\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"662\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"114\";}}}s:12:\"field_images\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:2:\"en\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:0:{}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2016-01-01 08:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_video\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:11:{s:11:\"field_image\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:8:\"og:image\";i:1;s:12:\"rdfs:seeAlso\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:10:\"dc:subject\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458111751,1),('9204','O:8:\"stdClass\":39:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"9208\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"9204\";s:4:\"type\";s:7:\"article\";s:8:\"language\";s:7:\"zh-hant\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"9203\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:3:\"217\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:7382:\"Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence<p>\n	The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (&ldquo;IOSCO&rdquo;) is now looking at a number of new issues and risks that have emerged in the over-the-counter derivatives markets following six years of reforms.

Regulations in the European Union and the United States allow netting to apply only if there is a valid netting agreement in place. </p>\n<p>	In Asia, where many jurisdictions have no valid netting opinions, netting becomes an issue, Jenkins said. \"If your counterparty is in a jurisdiction with no netting opinions, margin will be calculated on a gross basis, which is likely to be higher,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	Jenkins said the HKMA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are considering whether to introduce a threshold on transactions with counterparties in non-netting jurisdictions.<br />\n	 </p>\n\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:45:\"<p>Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\n\";}}}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_image\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"661\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"576\";}}}s:12:\"field_images\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:7:\"zh-hant\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:0:{}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2016-01-01 08:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_video\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:62:\"IOSCO Looks at New Risks Emerging from OTC Derivatives Reforms\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:11:{s:11:\"field_image\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:8:\"og:image\";i:1;s:12:\"rdfs:seeAlso\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:10:\"dc:subject\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458183993,1),('9207','O:8:\"stdClass\":39:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"9211\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:68:\"Implementing Prudential Regulations and New Issues Key Focus in 2016\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"9207\";s:4:\"type\";s:7:\"article\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"9207\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:3:\"217\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:6828:\"Patricia Lee, Regulatory Intelligence<p>\n	Eight years after the financial crisis, regulators will now focus on the implementation of prudential regulations, and this is likely to continue for at least another two years, officials said.<br />\n	<br />\n	Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, said in a recent speech that the series of international reforms which followed the crisis had reached a plateau.

Regulatory reforms are far from complete, however, as regulators now begin to deal with the consequences of implementing the various initiatives, and make legislative changes in the domestic markets to facilitate rule implementation over the next few years, according to Keith Pogson, partner at EY in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>	\"That\'s what most regulators\' agenda is going to be. It\'s not just catching up, but it\'s implementing locally what\'s going on globally, and making [the changes] happen. Basel III, total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”), and recovery and resolution plans, OTC derivatives reforms, CCPs, FATCA, all of this stuff has been coming for a long time,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	<strong>Policy Formulation Far from Complete<br /></strong><br />\n	Simon Topping, head of regulations for Asia Pacific at KPMG China, said that although regulators had completed most of the policy formulation and were moving toward implementation, some aspects of policy formulation were far from complete.</p>\n<p>	\"You have the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision [BCBS], the Financial Stability Board [FSB] and Mr. Carney saying they have finalised the policy formulation stage. That\'s largely true but there are important issues that are not resolved,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	Topping said the standardised approach to credit risk is an example of a piece of regulation which has a number of unresolved issues. He said the second consultation paper issued by the BCBS in December last year would present considerable challenges to banks, particularly to Asian banks.</p>\n<p>	\"Banks who will use the new standardised approach fear that it will result in higher risk-weighted assets and hence lower capital ratios. Moreover, there will also be an indirect effect on those banks using the internal ratings-based (“IRB”) approach, as the capital savings they can make will be constrained by the introduction of a floor calculated relative to the new standardised approach,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	Basel III is another area where implementation is expected to continue until 2018, according to Topping. Changes to Basel III are likely as the BCBS now attempts to evaluate it in a holistic manner and one of the possible changes is the removal of some of the capital buffers, he said.</p>\n<p>	Basel III requires banks to maintain a number of capital buffers, which some banks have considered duplicative. Topping said banks were hoping that BCBS would remove some of them.</p>\n<p>	\"BCBS is looking at whether there is a need to re-calibrate capital and banks are hoping that there will be a good outcome,\" he said.</p>\n<p>	The asset management sector could see important regulatory developments this year, said David Wright, secretary-general of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. Some banking regulators at the FSB are concerned about the risks posed by asset managers and whether the bigger players should be required to put in place specific measures, he said. Some feel that the new regulations on banks have shifted risks to asset managers and the shadow banking sector.</p>\n<p>	Wright said the FSB-IOSCO technical work group is carrying out in-depth analysis on the market activities of asset managers and no conclusions have so far been made.</p>\n<p>	\"The main \'activity\' issues are well known: looking primarily at liquidity and leverage issues.

According to figures from HKEx, the turnover of derivative warrants and callable bull/bear contracts in 2015 accounted for 17 percent and 7 percent of the securities market\'s total turnover.<br />\n	 </p>\n\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:44:\"<p>Trond Vagen, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\n\";}}}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_image\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"661\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"576\";}}}s:12:\"field_images\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:7:\"zh-hant\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:66:\"Hong Kong will Not Impose Stamp Duty on Derivatives, Says Official\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:66:\"Hong Kong will Not Impose Stamp Duty on Derivatives, Says Official\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:0:{}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2016-01-01 08:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_video\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:66:\"Hong Kong will Not Impose Stamp Duty on Derivatives, Says Official\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:11:{s:11:\"field_image\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:8:\"og:image\";i:1;s:12:\"rdfs:seeAlso\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:10:\"dc:subject\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458183993,1),('9213','O:8:\"stdClass\":39:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"9217\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:88:\"Nation-States will Crack Down Hard on Bitcoin because of Criminal Element, says Bernanke\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"9213\";s:4:\"type\";s:7:\"article\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"9213\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1454929177\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:3:\"217\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:3054:\"Ajay Shamdasani, Regulatory Intelligence<p>\n	National governments will crack down hard on Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies because of concerns such technologies can more easily facilitate terrorist financing and other criminal activities, said Ben Bernanke, former US Federal Reserve chairman.

China has been cautious,\" Bernanke said, reflecting on the 2008 global financial crisis in the West. \"If the banking system is not secure, if there is a shock from, say, sub-prime loans, that could bring down the entire system.\"<br />\n	 </p>\n\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:48:\"<p>Ajay Shamdasani, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\n\";}}}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_image\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"661\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"576\";}}}s:12:\"field_images\";a:0:{}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:7:\"zh-hant\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:88:\"Nation-States will Crack Down Hard on Bitcoin because of Criminal Element, says Bernanke\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:88:\"Nation-States will Crack Down Hard on Bitcoin because of Criminal Element, says Bernanke\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:0:{}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2016-01-01 08:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:11:\"field_video\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:88:\"Nation-States will Crack Down Hard on Bitcoin because of Criminal Element, says Bernanke\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:11:{s:11:\"field_image\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:8:\"og:image\";i:1;s:12:\"rdfs:seeAlso\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:10:\"field_tags\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:10:\"dc:subject\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1453939200\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458183993,1),('9225','O:8:\"stdClass\":39:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"9229\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:53:\"Keeping SME Firms Relevant in an Era of Globalisation\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"1\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"1\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"9225\";s:4:\"type\";s:7:\"article\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1454284800\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1455094820\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"9225\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1455094820\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:3:\"217\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:12068:\"<p>Tony Williams, Principal, Jomati Consultants LLP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is tempting to assume that cross﹣ border matters are the preserve of the major global law firms or at best of the leading national firms with high international reputations and a strong network of similar best friends. In an era of continued globalisation this is an unnecessarily restrictive and potentially defeatist view for a smaller law firm to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, the world has changed in many ways. The major economies of Europe and the US have encountered recession, low growth and strained government finances. Many developing countries have continued to grow with some achieving GDP growth rates in excess of 5 percent despite the market turbulence. Developing economies now account for about 30 percent of global outbound foreign direct investment and for the first time there is now more inbound foreign direct investment into the developing world than into the developed world. In 2008, 67 percent of the Global Fortune 500 companies were based in the US or EU but in 2014 that figure shrunk to 52 percent. Accordingly, the developing world, now the recipient of more inbound investment than the developed world, accounts for 30 percent of global outbound foreign direct investment and is home to a growing number of the world’s largest companies. In addition, trade routes for investment are now far more complex with investments from Asia to Africa, the Middle East to Asia and so on. It is no longer the case that every major investment has to be routed through the once dominant centres of London and New York. Clearly many emerging markets face some stiff headwinds with the reduction in commodity prices, the slowdown in China, expected increases in US interest rates and local currency weakness. But while these may impact short﹣term activity levels the current development of an inter-connected world seems unstoppable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This change provides a magnificent opportunity for smaller law firms especially in a thriving international business centre such as Hong Kong. Many domestic clients are getting larger; are looking to invest internationally; and foreign companies are looking to invest in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific. But, in order to grasp this opportunity for not only more, but potentially more interesting and profitable, work, firms need to position themselves in order to demonstrate their capability and relevance to clients (existing and potential).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Global Approach</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional approach to globalisation of the larger firms has been quite simply to “follow the money” and to either open offices or merge with local law firms in countries experiencing significant inbound or outbound work. This has resulted in over 30 law firms with revenues over US$1 billion of which about 10 have revenues near or in excess of US$2 billion. Indeed, as globalisation continues it is quite likely that we will see US$5 billion revenue law firms before too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening of many international offices is not a credible option for most smaller firms as it is simply too expensive, time consuming and difficult to compete in new markets against larger firms that have deep pockets. Many firms will also not wish to contemplate mergers as they value their independence, autonomy and culture too highly to allow themselves to be subsumed into a global firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Options for SME Firms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, there are other available options that smaller firms in Hong Kong should consider to remain competitive in the global economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first issue is to understand what is happening in the Hong Kong marketplace, specifically, in relation to existing and potential clients. To what extent are these clients looking to invest abroad; if so, where and in which sectors? Are foreign investors looking to invest in Hong Kong, if so where are they from and what are they looking to invest in? This is not a one-off exercise. Investment trends and fashions can change quite quickly as perceptions of particular countries and specific industries are impacted by political, economic and regulatory issues. Current areas of interest could be ASEAN, with the ASEAN Economic Community now a reality, or the Chinese Government’s “Belt and Road Initiative”, which is focused on a range of infrastructure and trade initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armed with this information a firm can identify jurisdictions where investment is going to or coming from, the likely sectors for such investment and the local and international clients that are likely to be involved in such transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm then has a number of options to pursue. It can contact firms in the relevant countries with a view to establishing some sort of working relationship or “best friends” arrangement. It can join one or more of a number of law firm networks, some of which are general and global and others of which are related to a specific practice area or geographic region. A best friend’s type arrangement can be private or publicly promoted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it may sound counter intuitive, there may also be significant benefit in establishing a relationship with a number of major international firms if they do not have a significant presence in Hong Kong. These firms are likely to have clients looking to invest in the region and are likely to have the capability to assist your clients internationally. Even foreign firms with a Hong Kong presence may not have a broad offering and may look to small local firms for assistance in such areas as real estate, employment and the like. Some international firms (although perhaps not the largest), have a relatively limited or even nonexistent Asian presence. Some also offer training and secondment opportunities that may be appealing to your lawyers. The potential disadvantage of working with them is that some will seek to dominate the matter and relegate you to a Hong Kong law role or even take the client altogether. Also, if they subsequently decide to open or expand an office in Hong Kong, they may seek to staff their new or expanded office by hiring the lawyers at your firm that they have worked with. These are not reasons to avoid working with such firms, but it is prudent to clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. These risks may be mitigated (but not totally excluded) by entering into a “no poaching” agreement relating to clients, partners and staff with the “best friend”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making It Work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the route (or routes) that are chosen, smaller firms should appreciate that relationships only work and develop if there is a level of commitment and energy on both sides. A “best friend” who you never meet, phone or email from one year to the next is in reality only a passing acquaintance. Unless you really get to know your counterparts your chances of delivering the level of service that clients need, expect and demand are low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many clients working on cross border matters are indifferent as to their law firm’s legal structure – whether that be a fully financially integrated international firm, a Swiss verein (ie, effectively an association of law firms operating under a common brand and with a level of management, and strategic co-ordination but usually without full profit sharing between the member firms), an association, a network or as best friends. However, clients are generally unforgiving about lack of co-ordination, point scoring between lawyers, turf wars as to who should be doing what and when, and blame shifting if things go wrong. Quite simply many clients want one key point of contact, preferably one bill, an efficient, commercial and ethical service, no unpleasant surprises and to ensure that their lawyers help them look good to their bosses. Getting the law right is a pre-requisite but so too is a responsive and efficient service, a problem solving rather than problem making approach and a clear understanding of the client’s commercial objectives and how to achieve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sort of service is not achieved by accident. It can only be achieved by investing time and energy in the relationships with the other law firms. This does mean the relationships have to be prioritised, with the most attention given to the countries from which or to which the investment flows are going to occur. It also means that some relationships will fail or will not develop as expected and an alternative firm may need to be found. In relation to larger economies such as China, it may be appropriate to have a range of relationships across a number of firms to address different geographic and practice area expertise, to mitigate potential client conflict risks and to maximise the flow of referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These relationships work most effectively where a number of lawyers are involved from each firm. A “gatekeeper” who keeps such relationships to himself is unlikely to benefit the firm as a whole. Many firms pool information as to their international contacts so that they are readily available to all in the firm. Such lists are most useful if they include details of work referred each way, comments on the firm’s performance and even client comments. This feedback also enables you to review how the relationship is working. For example, are you referring work to them but never getting anything back, how responsive and client﹣friendly are they and did they keep to the fee arrangement agreed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also particularly helpful if you can demonstrate your capability to clients and potential clients. Joint visits can be particularly useful (but only if you prepare properly beforehand). Briefings or seminars on issues and opportunities in relation to another country which involve lawyers from that country are also beneficial. This helps to demonstrate to your client or potential client that you are investing in your relationship so your firm can provide them with the services that they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a way of developing and deepening the relationship some firms arrange for lawyers in a particular practice area or sector to meet regularly (in person or by conference call) to discuss current trends, legal developments and business opportunities. This can result in the sharing of experience and the development of best practice. Other firms arrange secondments or training programmes between their firms. It can also be worthwhile to prepare information about each firm’s relevant expertise and experience, as client presentations often need to be prepared at short notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this may appear quite daunting to a relatively small law firm. However if efforts are properly focused and prioritised they can achieve significant results. Instant gratification may be unreasonable to expect, but our clients, who have adopted this approach, have been able to demonstrate their relevance to inbound and outbound investors and to build long term and profitable client relationships, which have significantly improved both their financial performance and how they are perceived in their local market. This is not to suggest that developing international relationships is easy or trouble free but there are real opportunities available to firms that apply a long term, systematic and rigorous approach to developing their international relationships and effectively demonstrate their capabilities to their current and target clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed in an era of continuing globalisation, firms face a stark choice. Engage with cross﹣border activity in the ways mentioned above or risk becoming irrelevant to existing clients as they develop internationally or missing out on international clients entering your market. In these circumstances, standing still can be the most dangerous plan.</p>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:57:\"<p>Tony Williams, Principal, Jomati Consultants LLP</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:11995:\"<p>Tony Williams, Principal, Jomati Consultants LLP</p>\n<p>It is tempting to assume that cross﹣ border matters are the preserve of the major global law firms or at best of the leading national firms with high international reputations and a strong network of similar best friends.

Williams，負責人，Jomati Consultants LLP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>一般人會認為，從事跨境法律業務，總是環球律師事務所，或享有國際盛名、擁有強大的最佳業務伙伴網絡的全國性律師事務所的專利。然而，在今天這一個全球化持續發展的時代中，上述的看法對規模較小的律師事務所而言，實在是不必要、過於局限和消極的。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>背景</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>自2008年的金融危機以來，全球在許多方面都發生了變化，歐洲及美國此等重要經濟體面對經濟衰退、低增長率、政府財政緊絀等問題。然而，許多發展中國家的經濟卻持續取得增長，而在動盪的市場環境中，當中仍有一些國家取得超過百分之五的國內生產總值增長率。在目前的全球對外直接投資中，發展中的經濟體約佔其中百分之三十，且首度出現發展中國家所吸收的外來直接投資超越發達國家的情況。在2008年的「全球財富500強」企業中，有百分之六十七將其總部設在美國或歐洲。到了2014年，這一數目已經下降至百分之五十二。由此可見，現時進入發展中國家的外來投資，比進入發達國家的為多，佔全球對外直接投資的百分之三十，而且正有越來越多的全球最大型企業在該等地區成立總部。此外，現時的投資貿易路線也遠比以往複雜，有從亞洲進入非洲的投資，也有從中東進入亞洲的投資，等等。因此，現在已經不再是每一項重大投資，都必須通過倫敦與紐約等曾經佔全球主導地位的經濟中心來進行。現時為數不少的新興市場正面對著若干困境，例如﹕商品價格下降、中國經濟增長放緩、美國的利率一如預期般攀升、本地貨幣疲弱等，這在短期內可能會對經濟活動構成影響。然而，一個互聯互通的世界發展趨勢，看來在當前是在所難免。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>機遇</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>此等變化，為規模較小的律師事務所帶來了重大機遇，尤其是像香港這樣一個繁盛的國際商務中心。本地許多客戶的業務規模日益擴大，它們正在尋找於海外進行投資的機會，而外國企業也正在尋找機會於香港及亞太地區進行投資。然而，律師事務所除了把握機會爭取更多業務外，也需要為自己進行定位，以爭取更多能帶來可觀收益的機遇，並向現有及潛在客戶展示其在提供有關法律服務方面的能力與適切性。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>全球性取態</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>大型律師事務所對全球化的傳統取態向來都是「向錢看」的，因此它們會選擇在涉及大量外來與對外投資的國家中開設辦事處，又或是與當地的律師事務所進行合併，而此舉也為30多家律師事務所帶來超過10億美元的盈利收益，當中有大約10家更錄得接近或超過20億美元的盈利收益。事實上，隨著全球化趨勢的持續，在不久的將來，相信將會出現創收達50億美元的律師事務所。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>對於大多數規模較小的律師事務所而言，前往其他國家開設眾多辦事處並非可行之舉，原因是在金錢和時間上耗費太大，而且要與實力雄厚的大型律師事務所在新市場進行競爭，確是談何容易。另一方面，對許多律師事務所來說，進行合併也並非它們所考慮的選項，因為它們都很重視自身的獨立性、自主性與機構文化，而不欲被一家全球性的大型律師事務所收編。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>中小型律師事務所的策略</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>然而，香港規模較小的律師事務所其實可以考慮採取其他策略來維持自身在環球經濟中的競爭力。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>首先，它們需要了解香港市場的狀況，尤其是與現有及潛在客戶相關的狀況。此等客戶對海外投資的渴望程度究竟有多高﹖它們希望在什麼國家及在什麼業務領域進行投資﹖此外，是否有外國投資者意欲前來香港投資﹖若然，它們是來自何方，以及計劃在什麼業務領域進行投資？但我們必須意識到，某些國家及某些行業的取向，會不時受政治、經濟及監管等方面的因素所影響，投資的趨向及方式因而可能會迅速改變。故上述的觀點，需要因應時局的變化而適時作出調整。當前最受人關注的議題，大概是東盟的發展(東盟經濟共同體現已形成)，以及中國政府的「一帶一路倡議」(該項倡議涉及一系列的基礎設施建設和貿易開拓)。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>在掌握了相關信息後，律師事務所便可以就以下各點進行識別﹕有關投資來自及前往什麼司法管轄區﹖該等投資將會進入什麼業務領域﹖以及，將會有什麼本地和國際客戶參與該等交易。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>在此等情況下，律師事務所可以實行以下舉措﹕它可以聯繫有關國家的律師事務所，並與它們建立某種形式的業務關係或「最佳業務伙伴」安排。此外，它也可以考慮加入一個或多個律師事務所網絡，而當中應有一些是一般性及概略性的，另一些則是與特定業務範疇或地區相關。「最佳業務伙伴」類別的安排，可以私下或公開的方式來推廣。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>與並沒有在香港經營重大業務的大型國際律師事務所建立關係，聽起來好像是有違常理，但事實上此舉可以帶來重大裨益。該等律師事務所可能擁有有意前來本地區投資的客戶，而它們或許也能在國際層面為貴所的客戶提供協助。若干即使有在香港經營業務的外國律師事務所，它們所提供服務的範圍可能會非常有限，因此需要在房地產、僱傭等領域，尋求本地較小規模的律師事務所的協助。有一些國際律師事務所(儘管它們也許不是規模最大)在亞洲區只提供頗為有限的法律服務，什至並無提供任何法律服務。此外，也有一些國際律師事務所會給律師提供培訓與借調機會，而這對貴所的律師而言可能具相當吸引力。然而，與這些國際律師事務所共同合作的可能缺點是，它們當中可能會有人試圖進行全面操控，並將貴所的地位貶抑至只是一個根據香港法例執業的角色，而且甚至會將客戶據為己有。此外，如果它們其後決定在香港開設或擴充辦事處，它們有可能會向貴所那些曾經與它們合作過的律師招手，邀請他們成為其新開設或進行擴充的辦事處中的一員。儘管這並不至於構成拒絕與該等律師事務所合作的理由，但在進行合作之前先行明瞭箇中可能的得與失，這也不失為審慎的做法。此外，倘若在與「最佳業務伙伴」合作之前，先行簽訂與客戶、合夥人及員工等有關的「不挖角」協議，這亦可將有關的風險減輕(但並非完全排除)。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>採取有效策略</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>無論是選擇哪一種途徑(或是選擇哪些途徑)，規模較小的律師事務所都應該意識到，只有雙方都具備相當的承諾和實力，才能夠建立及發展深具效益的協作關係。假如在整整一年內﹐你都沒有機會與你的「最佳業務伙伴」接觸，或是透過電話或電郵與它通訊，那麼實際上，它無異於只是你的一個擦肩而過的朋友而矣。除非你真正認識你的合作伙伴，否則便很難期望你所提供的服務能達至客戶所需、所期望及所要求。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>許多經營跨境業務的客戶，並不在意其律師事務所所採用的究竟是如何的法律結構。就是說，它可以是一家財政上完整的國際律師事務所﹔一種「律所合併」形式的結構(即是，它是一個律師事務所之間的聯盟，而雙方在共同的標誌下經營，設有管理層及策略性的協調，但在各成員之間，一般並無完全的利潤分成)，又或是一個聯合體、網絡，或作為最佳業務伙伴。但假如律師之間出現協調不足、相互攻擊，以及在處理某些業務及在何時處理方面，出現了勢力之爭，又或是在出了問題後雙方相互卸責﹐而這種種情況通常都不會獲得客戶的原諒。事實上，許多客戶所要求得到的其實很簡單，只不過是﹕一個主要聯絡點﹔只開出一張賬單﹔高效率、商業性、合乎操守的服務﹔沒有任何出乎人意料的不愉快事情﹔確保提供服務的律師能有助其達至僱主所要求的滿意成果。雖然正確地運用法律是一項先決條件，但其他不容忽略的事情還有﹕對需求作出適切回應的高效服務﹔專注於解決問題而非製造問題的服務取向﹔以及，對客戶的商業目標及如何將其達成有非常充分的了解。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>要提供此類服務，並不能夠單憑意外，而是需要投入時間和精力，從而與其他律師事務所建立穩固關係。這意味著，我們必須將關係的建立置於首位，並將注意力主要集中在吸收外來投資與進行對外投資的國家。此外，這也意味著，有某些關係是我們無法建立的，又或是並不能如預期般加以發展的。在這情況下，也許我們需要另覓其他律師事務所作為合作伙伴﹐而在一些龐大的經濟體(例如中國)，我們較為適宜採取的策略，是與多家律師事務所建立合作關係，從而取得在不同地域及不同實務領域的專門知識，並降低潛在的客戶衝突風險，以及最大限度地提升業務的轉介量。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>假如每家律師事務所都有律師參與其中，這便應當能夠在業務關係的建立上取得最大成效。不願意將其關係開放的「把關人」，將難以令律師事務所全體得益。許多律師事務所會將其有關國際聯繫的資料匯集起來，讓該所的全體員工可以隨時取用。該等資料如果包含所轉介業務的細節，以及對該律師事務所的服務表現評語(甚至是客戶評語)，這將能夠起更大的改進作用﹐而所獲得的回饋，將可有助我們就雙方的合作情況進行檢討。例如﹐對方是否在獲得你的業務轉介情況下，並沒有給你作出任何相應的業務轉介﹔其回應態度是否積極及能否做到以客為尊﹖其是否信守所協議的收費安排？</p>\r\n\r\n<p>若你能夠向客戶(及潛在客戶)展示你的處事能力，此舉將會給你帶來裨益，而如果進行聯袂造訪，這亦會帶來良好的效益(但首先你必須做好事前的充足準備)。此外，為律師舉辦簡報會或研討會，以與其所屬國家有關的議題和機遇作為討論重點，這也是別具意義的舉措。此等做法，有助你向你的客戶(或潛在客戶) 闡明你在建立關係方面所採取的積極態度，並顯示你有充分的能力為它們提供所需服務。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>為了進一步發展和加深雙方關係，一些律師事務所會安排該些在某一特定範疇或領域執業的律師定期會面(這可以是直接會面或透過電話會議進行商談)，就當前的趨勢、法律發展及商機交換意見，而此舉亦可有助雙方進行經驗交流和推廣最佳實務。此外，一些律師事務所也會進行人員借調或舉辦相關培訓課程。另一方面，律師事務所應當為其所積累的相關專門知識和經驗，製備完整的資料檔案以供參考備用，因為當有需要向客戶進行演示或簡報時，給予有關人員作準備的時間通常會十分短促。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>結論</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>上述所需採取的各項措施，有可能會令規模較小的律師事務所望而卻步。然而，如果它們能夠將重點和優先性等問題作出正確處理，便必然能夠有重大收獲。倘若我們期望能即時取得滿意的成果，這想法是有點不切實際，但已朝著這一方向努力的客戶，現時足可將其努力成果，展示予前來投資和進行對外投資的投資者，及與它們建立有意義的長遠客戶關係，並大大改善其財務表現，以及其予本地市場的感覺。這並不是說，在國際上建立業務關係是輕而易舉、毫無障礙的事情，但律師事務所在開展此等關係的過程中，如能按照長遠、有系統及嚴格的方針行事，並向其現有與潛在客戶展示自身的能力，便必定能夠取得良好的發展機遇。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>事實上，在一個全球化持續發展的時代，律師事務所正面臨著嚴峻的抉擇。如果我們不按上面所提述的各種方式般參與跨境業務，最終便可能無法在客戶所經營的國際業務中分一杯羹，又或是失去了進入本地市場投資的國際客戶。明乎此，我們便必然曉得固步自封、一成不變是不足為法的。</p>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:59:\"<p>Tony

It takes much restraint not to push the envelope too hard. There are times when you have to fight with your conscience.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before his appointment to the Bench, he acted as deputy judge of the Supreme Court (as the High Court was called prior to 1997) on many occasions and also served as the chairman of many statutory boards and tribunals, such as the Inland Revenue Board of Review and the Town Planning Appeal Board. “I felt totally comfortable in those capacities. You dealt with the issues before you the best you could, quickly and simply, free from external pressures, so being the decision-maker rather than the advocate was attractive to me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Vice President of the Court of Appeal, he said he was able to regulate (to some extent) its sittings. “It was a very efficient court. I do not recall a single case where judgment was not delivered within a few weeks – very often the day following the last hearing. We were well assisted by the secretaries and clerks.” It was a “professional environment” that I “thoroughly enjoyed”, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Most Difficult Case</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Litton has dealt with many difficult issues in many difficult cases, but the hardest, he said, was undoubtedly <a href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true#http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Bank of East Asia v Tsien Wui Marble Factory &amp; Palmer and Turner</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It concerned the new Bank of East Asia building, completed in 1982. Granite panels mounted on the concrete structure formed the cladding of the building. Some 10 years later the Bank became aware of serious defects in the cladding. It took the experts some time to discover the cause. Eventually the bank sued the supplier of the granite cladding and the architects.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At trial, the architects admitted they were negligent in the design of the cladding, but said that the Bank’s cause of action was time-barred under the Limitation Ordinance (the “LO”). This admission lulled the parties into thinking there were no factual issues to be tried. The sole question was thought to be purely one of law: in terms of s. 4(1) of the LO, when did the cause of action against the nominated subcontractor and the architects accrue? The trial judge found in favour of the Bank, but he was reversed by the Court of Appeal. So the Bank appeared before us in the CFA as the appellant.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the limitation issue was properly analysed, there were a number of possible dates when the cause of action might be said to have accrued. This depended on the facts, and there were few findings of fact in the lower courts, Mr. Litton explained. So one difficult issue was whether to send the case back to the trial court to make findings of fact. As the presiding judge, I was determined to avoid the “wasteful course” of sending it back to the trial court, he said. Instead, the CFA made additional findings of fact, based on the incontrovertible material before us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, the CFA dismissed the Bank’s appeal by a majority of 3-2, although on grounds different from those of the Court of Appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Judgment, Humility, Focus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three most important qualities Mr. Litton believes a judge should possess are judgment, humility and focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judgment relates to “the use of time and energy”. That is, to decide when a case should be “dealt with summarily”, and when it requires “deep analysis”. Too often trial judges agonize over trivia and lengthily discuss arcane points of law when all that is required is to apply the law, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good judge is also humble – they “see the world as the common man and woman sees it.” They don’t judge from “some great height”, with a <em>“wrinkled brow and sneer of cold command”</em>, he said, referencing the poet Keats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a good judge should also be focused, honing in on “the real issues” before them, while having the “wider horizon” (ie, the full scope of the case) in view. Good judges are not “ensnared in a tangle of words”. They judge issues, not personalities. Their conclusions accord with common sense, which lies at the heart of the common law, he explained. And they render a judgment which the average educated person can understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Linguistic Conundrum</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At the very heart of <em>One Country, Two Systems</em> is the common law system: a system which prevails in many jurisdictions, including the second most populous country in the world, India.” English is the “common language” of the common law and it is simply not possible for it to exist severed from its roots in the English language. Herein, he explained, lies “a conundrum.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 80 percent of the population unable to proficiently speak English, how can the common law remain effective in this community? Mr. Litton believes it boils down this: it must be expressed in a language which “the average educated person” can understand. In this multilingual city, when a judgment is given in English, as most of them are in the higher courts, a duty falls on the court to speak in a manner that not only makes it easy to understand in English, but also easy to translate into Chinese. This, to me, is “the guiding principle,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in other common law jurisdictions, where English is the common language, there has been a call for judges to avoid making judgments that, in the words of Lord Neuberger, are “readable by few, comprehendible by fewer still.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If justice is seen to be done,” said Lord Neuberger in a 2011 speech on open justice, “it must be understandable. Judgments must be open not only in the sense of being available to the public, but, so far as possible given the technical and complex nature of much of our law, they must also be clear and easily interpretable by lawyers. And also to non-lawyers. In an age when it seems more likely than ever that citizens will have to represent themselves, this is becoming increasingly important.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focused Judgments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judges can often be pretty prolix, and Mr.Litton believes judges can do better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Issue</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common law is focused on remedies and is formulated out of experience, real situations, he noted. It springs from pragmatism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trial judge’s primary function is to “find the facts relevant to the issues”, not engage in a “discourse about the law,” he said. “In the vast majority of cases, once such facts are found, the correct legal consequences follow.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequently, masses of irrelevant details and citations find their way into judgments that are not focused on the “real issues”, he said. And electronic media does make the problem any easier – it’s not only word processors, but also the easy access through the internet to almost every decided case. This seems to fuel the recent trend of counsel putting forward “every conceivable argument” and citing every tangentially relevant case that judges then laboriously go through in their judgments irrespective of their merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I was an appellate judge for nearly a quarter of a century, and I can tell you, it is not easy for a judge to break out of this paradigm, to set aside counsel’s argument and cast his eyes over the wider horizon.”<br />\r\nThe profession, on the other hand, can help improve matters and make the system more relevant and robust, by focusing on the facts of the case and exercising common sense, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lord Neuberger has also noted this trend in the UK, observing that sometimes judges feel the need to deal with every aspect of every point that is argued, which can make a judgment difficult and unrewarding to follow. “Reading some judgments one rather loses the will to live – and that is particularly disconcerting when it’s your own judgment that you are reading,” he has said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Short v Long</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what’s a judge to do when faced with the choice of writing a short or long judgment? On the face of it, Mr. Litton finds the answer to be obvious: judgments should be as short as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one should not give short shrift to the real risk involved with writing a judgment that is too abbreviated – that is, the risk of a judge not considering the issues and previous authorities properly. As explained by Lord Neuberger, “one of the main points of a judgment is to explain the decision to the parties, especially to the loser, to their lawyers and to any appellate court, and more generally to future potential litigants, to their lawyers, as well as to academics. And particularly in [a] common law precedent-based system, judges often should refer to and consider past decisions. So the shorter the better, but as with anything, you can have too much of a good thing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Judicial Review</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent comments made by Mr. Litton about the judicial review system in Hong Kong have generated considerable media and public attention, prompting many members of the legal community to weigh in on his appraisal, including the Hon. Chief Justice Ma and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Winnie Tam SC, at the Opening of the 2016 Legal Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Issue</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judicial review is focused on remedies (eg, orders of mandamus (mandatory orders), prohibition and certiorari (quashing orders)) that are available to deal with abuse of power, acting beyond jurisdiction and other actions of that nature on the part of the Government or public bodies. As such, they are “extremely important remedies”, Mr.Litton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with the threshold for judicial review,” he continued. “To get leave to start proceedings the applicant must satisfy the judge of the High Court that he has a reasonably arguable case for one of the reliefs mentioned earlier. This has been referred to as a ‘firewall’. Rightly so. It shields public officials from being vexed with frivolous and hopeless proceedings,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, the issue he takes with a handful of cases (eg, <a href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=I50159A5A3C8249D6AA01F8730D13B54D&amp;hitguid=I50159A5A3C8249D6AA01F8730D13B54D&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad69f8e00000152867ff5f527adc919&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Television Broadcasts v Communication Authority</em></a>, <a href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=I155871417DE64445ACD7C889E1F8F4D2&amp;hitguid=I155871417DE64445ACD7C889E1F8F4D2&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=ia744c09700000152868176ee789230be&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Kwok Cheuk Kin v Chief Executive &amp; the Government of the HKSAR and Yvonne Leung Lai Kwok</em></a>) is that the procedure adopted by the judge by-passed the “firewall”. He believes it gave “oxygen” to frivolous and vexatious applications that should have been screened out. “Full stop.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believes it is “crucial” for public authorities to have confidence in the processes of the High Court. “For the Court to fail in maintaining the discipline of law, and allow its processes to be abused, erodes such confidence.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Appraisal</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vigor with which a view is expressed should not detract from its substance or be misconstrued. So Mr. Litton’s appraisal is to be put in context. The concern is brevity, efficient use of court resources and discipline of the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vital role of judicial review is acknowledged especially in the unique circumstances of <em>“One Country, Two Systems”</em>. It has not been said that every unsuccessful application is an abuse of process. Nor is it denied that judicial review and convenience are sometimes not on speaking terms. Judicial reviews might cause delays and increased costs but those things are unavoidable in maintaining the rule of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as for the substance, many have persuasively elaborated on why the overall system is sound and why it is of equal importance to buttress public confidence in the judiciary and rule of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Paul Shieh SC, former Chairman of the Bar, said “[i]ndeed [the] very existence [of judicial review] is a good thing and marks Hong Kong from mainland China. It has room for improvement in that judges can be expected to be more robust in screening out undeserving cases, but very often judicial review applications take place against a polarized political background.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In order that their decisions are not criticised (wrongly, and almost as a kneejerk [reaction]) by interested parties as ‘the death of the rule of law’ (or evidencing ‘the judiciary turning red’), judges can be forgiven for spending more time and effort in demonstrating that the unsuccessful applicant has had a fair hearing and in explaining in greater detail why he or she has lost.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hoped that the profession and the judiciary will continue to meaningfully evaluate these issues and seek to improve, as and when the need arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Life after the CFA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an Honorary Professor of Law in the Faculty of Law at the Hong Kong University, Mr. Litton hopes to continue contributing to the development of the law in Hong Kong in the years to come. “In particular, I shall continue to advocate simplicity, clarity and sharp focus in the law. These are all essential to make the common law an effective implement of good governance in Hong Kong, in tune with the needs of the age.”</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"padding:5px;width:25%\"><img align=\"top\" alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Feb2016/Coverstory_01.jpeg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></td>\r\n			<td style=\"padding:5px\">\r\n			<p>Hon.

In an age when it seems more likely than ever that citizens will have to represent themselves, this is becoming increasingly important.”</p>\n<p><strong>Focused Judgments</strong></p>\n<p>Judges can often be pretty prolix, and Mr.Litton believes judges can do better.</p>\n<p><em>The Issue</em></p>\n<p>Common law is focused on remedies and is formulated out of experience, real situations, he noted. It springs from pragmatism.</p>\n<p>The trial judge’s primary function is to “find the facts relevant to the issues”, not engage in a “discourse about the law,” he said. “In the vast majority of cases, once such facts are found, the correct legal consequences follow.”</p>\n<p>Frequently, masses of irrelevant details and citations find their way into judgments that are not focused on the “real issues”, he said. And electronic media does make the problem any easier – it’s not only word processors, but also the easy access through the internet to almost every decided case. This seems to fuel the recent trend of counsel putting forward “every conceivable argument” and citing every tangentially relevant case that judges then laboriously go through in their judgments irrespective of their merit.</p>\n<p>“I was an appellate judge for nearly a quarter of a century, and I can tell you, it is not easy for a judge to break out of this paradigm, to set aside counsel’s argument and cast his eyes over the wider horizon.”<br />\nThe profession, on the other hand, can help improve matters and make the system more relevant and robust, by focusing on the facts of the case and exercising common sense, he added.</p>\n<p>Lord Neuberger has also noted this trend in the UK, observing that sometimes judges feel the need to deal with every aspect of every point that is argued, which can make a judgment difficult and unrewarding to follow. “Reading some judgments one rather loses the will to live – and that is particularly disconcerting when it’s your own judgment that you are reading,” he has said.</p>\n<p><em>Short v Long</em></p>\n<p>So what’s a judge to do when faced with the choice of writing a short or long judgment? On the face of it, Mr. Litton finds the answer to be obvious: judgments should be as short as possible.</p>\n<p>However, one should not give short shrift to the real risk involved with writing a judgment that is too abbreviated – that is, the risk of a judge not considering the issues and previous authorities properly. As explained by Lord Neuberger, “one of the main points of a judgment is to explain the decision to the parties, especially to the loser, to their lawyers and to any appellate court, and more generally to future potential litigants, to their lawyers, as well as to academics. And particularly in [a] common law precedent-based system, judges often should refer to and consider past decisions. So the shorter the better, but as with anything, you can have too much of a good thing.”</p>\n<p><strong>Judicial Review</strong></p>\n<p>Recent comments made by Mr. Litton about the judicial review system in Hong Kong have generated considerable media and public attention, prompting many members of the legal community to weigh in on his appraisal, including the Hon. Chief Justice Ma and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, Winnie Tam SC, at the Opening of the 2016 Legal Year.</p>\n<p><em>The Issue</em></p>\n<p>Judicial review is focused on remedies (eg, orders of mandamus (mandatory orders), prohibition and certiorari (quashing orders)) that are available to deal with abuse of power, acting beyond jurisdiction and other actions of that nature on the part of the Government or public bodies. As such, they are “extremely important remedies”, Mr.Litton said.</p>\n<p>“There is nothing wrong with the threshold for judicial review,” he continued. “To get leave to start proceedings the applicant must satisfy the judge of the High Court that he has a reasonably arguable case for one of the reliefs mentioned earlier. This has been referred to as a ‘firewall’. Rightly so. It shields public officials from being vexed with frivolous and hopeless proceedings,” he said.</p>\n<p>Rather, the issue he takes with a handful of cases (eg, <a href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=I50159A5A3C8249D6AA01F8730D13B54D&amp;hitguid=I50159A5A3C8249D6AA01F8730D13B54D&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad69f8e00000152867ff5f527adc919&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Television Broadcasts v Communication Authority</em></a>, <a href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=I155871417DE64445ACD7C889E1F8F4D2&amp;hitguid=I155871417DE64445ACD7C889E1F8F4D2&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=ia744c09700000152868176ee789230be&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Kwok Cheuk Kin v Chief Executive &amp; the Government of the HKSAR and Yvonne Leung Lai Kwok</em></a>) is that the procedure adopted by the judge by-passed the “firewall”. He believes it gave “oxygen” to frivolous and vexatious applications that should have been screened out. “Full stop.”</p>\n<p>He believes it is “crucial” for public authorities to have confidence in the processes of the High Court. “For the Court to fail in maintaining the discipline of law, and allow its processes to be abused, erodes such confidence.”</p>\n<p><em>The Appraisal</em></p>\n<p>The vigor with which a view is expressed should not detract from its substance or be misconstrued. So Mr. Litton’s appraisal is to be put in context. The concern is brevity, efficient use of court resources and discipline of the law.</p>\n<p>The vital role of judicial review is acknowledged especially in the unique circumstances of <em>“One Country, Two Systems”</em>. It has not been said that every unsuccessful application is an abuse of process. Nor is it denied that judicial review and convenience are sometimes not on speaking terms. Judicial reviews might cause delays and increased costs but those things are unavoidable in maintaining the rule of law.</p>\n<p>However, as for the substance, many have persuasively elaborated on why the overall system is sound and why it is of equal importance to buttress public confidence in the judiciary and rule of law.</p>\n<p>For instance, Paul Shieh SC, former Chairman of the Bar, said “[i]ndeed [the] very existence [of judicial review] is a good thing and marks Hong Kong from mainland China. It has room for improvement in that judges can be expected to be more robust in screening out undeserving cases, but very often judicial review applications take place against a polarized political background.”</p>\n<p>“In order that their decisions are not criticised (wrongly, and almost as a kneejerk [reaction]) by interested parties as ‘the death of the rule of law’ (or evidencing ‘the judiciary turning red’), judges can be forgiven for spending more time and effort in demonstrating that the unsuccessful applicant has had a fair hearing and in explaining in greater detail why he or she has lost.”</p>\n<p>It is hoped that the profession and the judiciary will continue to meaningfully evaluate these issues and seek to improve, as and when the need arises.</p>\n<p><strong>Life after the CFA</strong></p>\n<p>As an Honorary Professor of Law in the Faculty of Law at the Hong Kong University, Mr. Litton hopes to continue contributing to the development of the law in Hong Kong in the years to come. “In particular, I shall continue to advocate simplicity, clarity and sharp focus in the law. These are all essential to make the common law an effective implement of good governance in Hong Kong, in tune with the needs of the age.”</p>\n<hr /><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 100%\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5px;width:25%\"><img align=\"top\" alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/images/Issues/Feb2016/Coverstory_01.jpeg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></td>\n<td style=\"padding:5px\">\n<p>Hon.

href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true#http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Bank of East Asia v Tsien Wui Marble Factory &amp; Palmer and Turner</em></a>案。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「該案涉及1982年新落成的東亞銀行大廈。建築物外覆以混疑土鋪上花崗岩石板。十幾年後，銀行發現外覆出現嚴重缺陷。專家們花了好些時間才找出原因。最終，銀行起訴花崗岩外覆供應商和建築師。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「審訊時，建築師承認設計外覆時有所疏忽，但指根據《時效條例》，銀行的訴訟因由已經超過時效期限。此供認令雙方以為再無事實爭議可訴，認為唯一問題是純粹的法律問題：根據《時效條例》第4(1)條，針對指定分判商和建築師的訴訟因由從何時產生？原審法官裁定銀行勝訴，但被上訴法庭推翻。於是銀行上訴至終審法院。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>列顯倫先生解釋：「恰當分析時效問題時，多個日子或可被視作訴訟因由的產生日期，這視乎事實而定，而下級法院對事實調查較少。所以，其中一個困難之處乃是否將案件發還原審法庭進行事實調查。作為主審法官，我決心避免『浪費程序』，否決將案件發還原審法庭。相反，終審法院以手上無可爭辯的材料為基礎，作出額外的事實調查。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>終審法院最終以3比2大多數駁回銀行的上訴，不過理據有異於上訴法庭。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>判斷、謙遜、專注</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>列顯倫先生相信，法官應具備的三個最重要質素是判斷、謙遜和專注。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>判斷關乎「時間和精力的運用」，也就是決定案件何時應「循簡易程序處理」，何時需要「深入分析」。原審法官往往苦於對晦澀法律觀點煩瑣而冗長的討論，而其實只需引用法律。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>一個好的法官也要謙遜 － 引用詩人濟慈的說話，他們要「與一般人無異地看世界」，不要「站在高地，皺著眉頭、冷笑著」來作出判斷。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>最後，一個好的法官也應該專注，著眼當前「真正問題」，但同時保持「更廣闊」 (即案件的整個範圍)的視野。他解釋，好的法官不「糾纏於文字」。他們對事而不對人。他們的結論符合常理，而常理是普通法的核心。他們的判決，即使一般教育程度的人也能理解。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>語言難題</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>「『一國兩制』的核心是普通法制度。多個司法管轄區採用普通法制度，包括全球人口第二多的國家印度」。英語是普通法的「通用語言」，普通法根本不可能與英語脫鉤。他解釋，這裡存在一個「難題」。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>八成人口未能操流利英語，普通法怎能在這個社會保持有效？列顯倫先生相信，歸根究柢，法律必須以「一般教育程度的人」能夠理解的語言來表達。在這個多語城市，判決用英語，因為判決大多由上級法庭作出，法庭有責任令英語判決不僅易於明白，也易於翻譯成中文。他說：「對我來說，這是『指導原則』。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>即使在其他採用普通法而以英語為通用語言的司法管轄區，也有要求法官避免判決用字一如廖柏嘉勳爵(Lord Neuberger)所說：「能讀的人少，能理解的人更少」。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>廖柏嘉勳爵在2011年就司法公開作演說時表示，「讓人們看到司法得到伸張，它就必須令人能夠理解。判決公開的意義不僅指公眾能夠取閱，亦指在法律的技術性和複雜性本質許可的情況下，判決必須清晰，讓律師容易闡釋。對非律師亦然。今時今日，市民比以前更有可能自行應訊，這就變得越來越重要。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>重點明確的判決</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>法官有時會頗為煩冗，列顯倫先生相信法官們可以做得更好。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>問題所在</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>他指出，普通法以尋救補救為重點，按經驗、實際情況制訂。這都起源於實用主義。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>他說，原審法官的主要功能是「找出事件的相關事實」，而非參與「法律的辯論」。「在絕大部份案件，一旦這些事實被找出，正確的法律後果就隨之而來」。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>他說，很多時判決加入大量不相關的細節和引述，而非集中於「真正問題」。電子媒體令問題更加複雜 － 它不僅是文字處理器，也令通過互聯網取得幾乎所有案件判決變得容易。這似乎加劇了一個趨勢，就是律師們提出「每一個可以想象的論點」，援引所有不大相關的案件，然後法官又在判決內費力地仔細解釋，不論其價值如何。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>「我擔任上訴法官近四分一個世紀，我可以告訴你，法官要打破這種模式，撇開律師的論點，放眼更廣，並非易事」。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>另一方面，法律界可以出一分力，把重點放在案件的事實，運用常識，令整個系統更具針對性、更加有效。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>廖柏嘉勳爵也注意到這個趨勢在英國出現，他觀察到，法官有時覺得需要講解每個爭論點的方方面面，因而令判決艱深難明。他說過：「讀判決書有時令人失去生存意志－尤其是讀有關自己的判決書，就更令人不安。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>短或長</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>那麼，法官撰寫判決時，長短應如何取捨呢？列顯倫先生認為，答案是顯而易見：判決應該越短越好。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>不過，判決太過精簡會帶來風險，即法官沒有恰當考慮問題及此前所涉機關，這個風險不應予以忽視。正如廖柏嘉勳爵解釋：「判決的重點是向當事人(尤其是敗訴方)、他們的律師、任何上訴法庭、日後有機會提出訴訟的人士及他們的律師和學術界解釋決定。特別是在以普通法為基礎的體系，法官通常參考和考慮過往的決定。所以越短越好，但與任何事情一樣，好事過頭反成壞事。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>司法覆核</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>列顯倫先生最近就司法覆核的評論，引起傳媒和公眾廣泛關注，亦促使不少法律界人士作出回應，包括首席法官馬道立及香港大律師公會主席譚允芝資深大律師，於2016年法律年度開啟典禮上作出回應。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>問題所在</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>司法覆核的重點是尋求補救(例如履行義務令(強制令)、禁止令或移審令(撤銷令)去處理政府或公共機構濫用權力、行為不公等同類行為。列顯倫先生說，因此司法覆核是「極度重要的補救」。<br />\r\n他續說：「司法覆核的門檻本身沒有問題，要啟動程序，申請人必須令高等法院法官認同就上述的行為有合理的可爭辯理由。這被視為『防火牆』。這是理所當然的。它保護政府官員免受輕率、無聊的訴訟困擾。」</p>\r\n\r\n<p>相反，他舉出少數例子(例如<a

href=\"http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true#http://login.westlawasia.com/maf//app/document?&amp;src=search&amp;docguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;hitguid=ICD8AE85D7AFB487DB0627AE1F61E308F&amp;rank=1&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;snippets=true&amp;srguid=i0ad6290300000152867c89ecca2f9f81&amp;keep-search-state-crumb=true&amp;maintain-toc-node=true\"><em>Bank of East Asia v Tsien Wui Marble Factory &amp; Palmer and Turner</em></a>案。</p>\n<p>「該案涉及1982年新落成的東亞銀行大廈。建築物外覆以混疑土鋪上花崗岩石板。十幾年後，銀行發現外覆出現嚴重缺陷。專家們花了好些時間才找出原因。最終，銀行起訴花崗岩外覆供應商和建築師。」</p>\n<p>「審訊時，建築師承認設計外覆時有所疏忽，但指根據《時效條例》，銀行的訴訟因由已經超過時效期限。此供認令雙方以為再無事實爭議可訴，認為唯一問題是純粹的法律問題：根據《時效條例》第4(1)條，針對指定分判商和建築師的訴訟因由從何時產生？原審法官裁定銀行勝訴，但被上訴法庭推翻。於是銀行上訴至終審法院。」</p>\n<p>列顯倫先生解釋：「恰當分析時效問題時，多個日子或可被視作訴訟因由的產生日期，這視乎事實而定，而下級法院對事實調查較少。所以，其中一個困難之處乃是否將案件發還原審法庭進行事實調查。作為主審法官，我決心避免『浪費程序』，否決將案件發還原審法庭。相反，終審法院以手上無可爭辯的材料為基礎，作出額外的事實調查。」</p>\n<p>終審法院最終以3比2大多數駁回銀行的上訴，不過理據有異於上訴法庭。</p>\n<p><strong>判斷、謙遜、專注</strong></p>\n<p>列顯倫先生相信，法官應具備的三個最重要質素是判斷、謙遜和專注。</p>\n<p>判斷關乎「時間和精力的運用」，也就是決定案件何時應「循簡易程序處理」，何時需要「深入分析」。原審法官往往苦於對晦澀法律觀點煩瑣而冗長的討論，而其實只需引用法律。</p>\n<p>一個好的法官也要謙遜 － 引用詩人濟慈的說話，他們要「與一般人無異地看世界」，不要「站在高地，皺著眉頭、冷笑著」來作出判斷。</p>\n<p>最後，一個好的法官也應該專注，著眼當前「真正問題」，但同時保持「更廣闊」 (即案件的整個範圍)的視野。他解釋，好的法官不「糾纏於文字」。他們對事而不對人。他們的結論符合常理，而常理是普通法的核心。他們的判決，即使一般教育程度的人也能理解。</p>\n<p><strong>語言難題</strong></p>\n<p>「『一國兩制』的核心是普通法制度。多個司法管轄區採用普通法制度，包括全球人口第二多的國家印度」。英語是普通法的「通用語言」，普通法根本不可能與英語脫鉤。他解釋，這裡存在一個「難題」。</p>\n<p>八成人口未能操流利英語，普通法怎能在這個社會保持有效？列顯倫先生相信，歸根究柢，法律必須以「一般教育程度的人」能夠理解的語言來表達。在這個多語城市，判決用英語，因為判決大多由上級法庭作出，法庭有責任令英語判決不僅易於明白，也易於翻譯成中文。他說：「對我來說，這是『指導原則』。」</p>\n<p>即使在其他採用普通法而以英語為通用語言的司法管轄區，也有要求法官避免判決用字一如廖柏嘉勳爵(Lord Neuberger)所說：「能讀的人少，能理解的人更少」。</p>\n<p>廖柏嘉勳爵在2011年就司法公開作演說時表示，「讓人們看到司法得到伸張，它就必須令人能夠理解。判決公開的意義不僅指公眾能夠取閱，亦指在法律的技術性和複雜性本質許可的情況下，判決必須清晰，讓律師容易闡釋。對非律師亦然。今時今日，市民比以前更有可能自行應訊，這就變得越來越重要。」</p>\n<p><strong>重點明確的判決</strong></p>\n<p>法官有時會頗為煩冗，列顯倫先生相信法官們可以做得更好。</p>\n<p><em>問題所在</em></p>\n<p>他指出，普通法以尋救補救為重點，按經驗、實際情況制訂。這都起源於實用主義。</p>\n<p>他說，原審法官的主要功能是「找出事件的相關事實」，而非參與「法律的辯論」。「在絕大部份案件，一旦這些事實被找出，正確的法律後果就隨之而來」。</p>\n<p>他說，很多時判決加入大量不相關的細節和引述，而非集中於「真正問題」。電子媒體令問題更加複雜 － 它不僅是文字處理器，也令通過互聯網取得幾乎所有案件判決變得容易。這似乎加劇了一個趨勢，就是律師們提出「每一個可以想象的論點」，援引所有不大相關的案件，然後法官又在判決內費力地仔細解釋，不論其價值如何。</p>\n<p>「我擔任上訴法官近四分一個世紀，我可以告訴你，法官要打破這種模式，撇開律師的論點，放眼更廣，並非易事」。</p>\n<p>另一方面，法律界可以出一分力，把重點放在案件的事實，運用常識，令整個系統更具針對性、更加有效。</p>\n<p>廖柏嘉勳爵也注意到這個趨勢在英國出現，他觀察到，法官有時覺得需要講解每個爭論點的方方面面，因而令判決艱深難明。他說過：「讀判決書有時令人失去生存意志－尤其是讀有關自己的判決書，就更令人不安。」</p>\n<p><em>短或長</em></p>\n<p>那麼，法官撰寫判決時，長短應如何取捨呢？列顯倫先生認為，答案是顯而易見：判決應該越短越好。</p>\n<p>不過，判決太過精簡會帶來風險，即法官沒有恰當考慮問題及此前所涉機關，這個風險不應予以忽視。正如廖柏嘉勳爵解釋：「判決的重點是向當事人(尤其是敗訴方)、他們的律師、任何上訴法庭、日後有機會提出訴訟的人士及他們的律師和學術界解釋決定。特別是在以普通法為基礎的體系，法官通常參考和考慮過往的決定。所以越短越好，但與任何事情一樣，好事過頭反成壞事。」</p>\n<p><strong>司法覆核</strong></p>\n<p>列顯倫先生最近就司法覆核的評論，引起傳媒和公眾廣泛關注，亦促使不少法律界人士作出回應，包括首席法官馬道立及香港大律師公會主席譚允芝資深大律師，於2016年法律年度開啟典禮上作出回應。</p>\n<p><em>問題所在</em></p>\n<p>司法覆核的重點是尋求補救(例如履行義務令(強制令)、禁止令或移審令(撤銷令)去處理政府或公共機構濫用權力、行為不公等同類行為。列顯倫先生說，因此司法覆核是「極度重要的補救」。<br />\n他續說：「司法覆核的門檻本身沒有問題，要啟動程序，申請人必須令高等法院法官認同就上述的行為有合理的可爭辯理由。這被視為『防火牆』。這是理所當然的。它保護政府官員免受輕率、無聊的訴訟困擾。」</p>\n<p>相反，他舉出少數例子(例如<a

Lam, Legal Counsel, KPMG</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheung Yuet Road was all but deserted when I arrived at the Porsche Centre, near the Kowloon Bay Sports Ground. The air was crisp, but the sky was blue and beams of sunlight seemed to dance across the hoods of the new Porsche models on display in the showroom. As David Chan, the Porsche representative, greeted me, a white Cabriolet parked on the adjacent curb with its top down caught my eye. My anticipation began to boil over, as David confirmed that was the model we’d be taking for a spin, as I have never driven a convertible in Hong Kong!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Body Work and Interior</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cabriolet had every sporty detail you can imagine, including comfortable leather sports seats, sideskirts, exhausts, rear grille and apron, alloys, sports design steering wheels, exterior mirrors. You name it, it had it. And of course its trimmings were elegant – exactly what you expect from Porsche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But of all of the gizmos and gadgets, the driver’s seat that had to be manually adjusted impressed me the most.

The air was crisp, but the sky was blue and beams of sunlight seemed to dance across the hoods of the new Porsche models on display in the showroom. As David Chan, the Porsche representative, greeted me, a white Cabriolet parked on the adjacent curb with its top down caught my eye. My anticipation began to boil over, as David confirmed that was the model we’d be taking for a spin, as I have never driven a convertible in Hong Kong!</p>\n<p><strong>Body Work and Interior</strong></p>\n<p>The Cabriolet had every sporty detail you can imagine, including comfortable leather sports seats, sideskirts, exhausts, rear grille and apron, alloys, sports design steering wheels, exterior mirrors. You name it, it had it. And of course its trimmings were elegant – exactly what you expect from Porsche.</p>\n<p>But of all of the gizmos and gadgets, the driver’s seat that had to be manually adjusted impressed me the most.

One of the fruits of this exercise is the development of an economic framework for analysing transactions (the “Economic Framework”). The Economic Framework provides insights into the economics of commercial transactions by distilling the complexities of the economic relationship between contracting parties into four categories of commercial risks. It thereby provides a systematic structure for understanding and designing complex transactions. This article outlines the Economic Framework and examines how it operates in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Economic Framework</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of any commercial transaction is the economic relationship between the contracting parties. The complexities of this relationship shape the structure and terms of the deal. The Economic Framework disentangles these complexities by classifying them into the following four categories of risk, which are known in economics as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>adverse selection;</li>\r\n	<li>moral hazard;</li>\r\n	<li>asset specificity; and</li>\r\n	<li>exogenous factors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The above classifications identify the commercial risks inherent in the complex economic relationship between the contracting parties and, more importantly, the cause of such risks. By understanding the cause, the practitioner is in a better position to evaluate the likelihood of the risk and to devise a targeted response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article examines each commercial risk category and the contractual responses typical to each risk, illustrating how the Economic Framework works in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adverse Selection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put simply, adverse selection is the risk of overpaying for an asset (from a buyer’s perspective) and underselling an asset (from a seller’s perspective). It arises as a result of pre-contractual information asymmetry between the parties regarding the value and quality of the target asset, with the seller usually possessing more information than the buyer. This information asymmetry could potentially break the deal: the buyer may undervalue the target asset simply because it lacks the data to make an informed assessment, and the seller, having a higher valuation of the asset because it has more information, may be unwilling to sell at a lower price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical solutions to adverse selection can be divided into two groups. The first group consists of solutions that bridge the information gap through information exchange. Due diligence is representative of solutions in this category. Through the due diligence exercise, the seller communicates information about the target asset to the buyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due diligence has its limitations. The seller may flood the buyer with information regardless of its relevance and materiality. Given cost and time restraints, the buyer’s review of the information provided will necessarily be limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To some extent, the failings of due diligence can be addressed by well-structured disclosure mechanisms. A disclosure mechanism that absolves the seller’s liability in respect of disclosed matters could encourage the seller to volunteer material information in a focused manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second group of solutions involves the seller providing some sort of “guarantee” regarding the value of the target asset. Typical examples include the seller providing representations and warranties regarding the condition of the target asset. These “guarantees” will usually be subject to time and monetary limits, which are heavily negotiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, “guarantees” address the risk of adverse selection. On the other hand, they create credit and security risks: the “guarantees” will be worthless if the seller becomes impecunious or is difficult to locate. Such risks are often addressed by the buyer retaining part of the purchase price for a certain period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warranty and indemnity insurance is also gaining popularity amongst contracting parties as an alternative, or in addition, to the retention mechanism described above. The insurance ensures a clean exit for the seller and gives the buyer the ability to recover warranty and indemnity claims from a financially viable insurer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moral Hazard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, the quality of a party’s performance of its contractual obligations may not be immediately apparent due to the difficulties in monitoring and measuring its performance. The greater the difficulty in determining the quality of performance, the greater the risk of opportunistic behaviours such as shirking from responsibilities and diverting value for personal gains. “Moral hazard” is the term used to describe the risk of opportunistic behaviour in these situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical solutions to moral hazard can be divided into two groups. The first group consists of solutions that improve access to information. For example, an investor who holds a minority stake in a company may, under the investment documents, require the company to provide it with regular financial information and to notify it upon the occurrence of certain events material to the value or operation of the company. A minority investor with particularly strong bargaining power may also secure a right to audit the company’s accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second group of solutions involves some kind of alignment of interest, usually by way of financial incentives. Take for example a sale of the entire equity interest in a company where the sellers are retained post-completion to manage the company. An earn-out structure that increases the purchase price with reference to the company’s performance post-completion can incentivise the sellers to maximise the company’s profits, thereby aligning the interests of the buyer and sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the parties’ interests are perfectly aligned, the problem of moral hazard will disappear altogether. Whilst perfect alignment is rare (if indeed possible), a well-structured mechanism will align the parties’ interests as closely as possible by using performance indicators that are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>easy to measure;</li>\r\n	<li>most likely to accurately reflect the sellers’ actual efforts;</li>\r\n	<li>least likely to be distorted by external factors such as the general economic climate; and</li>\r\n	<li>least likely to create perverse incentives such as over-cautiousness or excessive risk-taking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Asset Specificity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where a party makes a substantial investment that is (1) specific to one transaction and (2) difficult to transfer to a third party, then there is a risk that the non-investing party will exploit the investing party because it knows that the investing party is “locked-in”. “Asset specificity” is the term used to describe this situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of a sale of a corporate group by way of a share deal, asset specificity may occur if the buyer requires the seller to re-organise the target group before completing the transaction. If the re-organisation makes sense only for the buyer because of its own unique tax or corporate structure, then there is a large hold-up risk for the seller because other potential buyers may not be interested in the re-organised target group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical responses to asset specificity seek to increase the non-investing party’s exit cost and cost of opportunistic behaviour. So for example, in the re-organisation scenario mentioned above, the seller may require the buyer to bear all or some of the re-organisation cost. Other examples of solutions in this group include taking deposits, break fees and put or call options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exogenous Factors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term “exogenous factors” refers to circumstances that are beyond the control of the parties, such as merger clearance, inflation and the stability of the financial system. Exogenous factors disrupt the intended course of performance of contractual obligations by, for example, making it more costly for one party to perform its obligations or reducing the value of the target asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical solutions for dealing with exogenous factors fall into three groups. The first group simply allocates the risk of exogenous factors between the parties. For example, if completion of a transaction is conditional upon the absence of material adverse change, then the seller bears the risk of the occurrence of exogenous factors that trigger a material adverse change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second group of solutions involves the parties settling on “standards” of performance (such as “reasonableness” and “due care”) instead of detailed “rules” of performance. Since “standards” are more flexible than “rules”, it permits the parties to adjust performance in light of changing circumstances, without amending the contract. However, the flexibility of “standards” also creates ambiguity, which makes “standards” more prone to litigation and disputes than “rules”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether “standards” or “rules” should be adopted in a particular case depends on a number of factors, including the extent to which an obligation can be precisely delineated, the complexity of the obligation, the cost of setting out and agreeing upon precise terms of performance, and the cost of enforcement through legal proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third group of solutions involves some sort of mechanism for re-adjusting the affected contractual obligation. For example, instead of expressing the price as a fixed figure, it can be expressed as a formula consisting of variable components to be ascertained at a future date. Parties may also design a mechanism for negotiating changes to the contract upon the occurrence of exogenous factors, or simply appoint an independent third party to determine potential areas of dispute such as the fair value of an asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Economic Framework provides a structure for understanding and thinking about commercial transactions from an economic perspective. By structuring the analytical process in terms of commercial risks, the Economic Framework helps practitioners to discern the financial dynamics that drive transactions and to develop targeted responses.</p>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:46:\"<p>Xin Fang, Associate, Mayer Brown JSM.</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:10440:\"<p>Xin Fang, Associate, Mayer Brown JSM</p>\n<p>In recent years, the legal profession in the UK and the US have been working with economists in order to unravel the complex structure of commercial transactions.

Faculty of Law, The Chinese University of Hong Kong</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conducted in English</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long-held belief in Chinese legal and business history is that the non-development of capitalism – as well as a commercial legal system that underpins it – in imperial China has to do with the nature of traditional Chinese businesses. According to Fairbank (1992), ‘[b]usiness was a segment of the whole web of friendship, kinship obligations, and personal relations that supported Chinese life’. Put it more bluntly, businesses were but a commercialized form of family relations.

July 2015, the Law Society Cookery, Food and Wine Appreciation Group took a fascinating gourmet trip to Barcelona, a city of sunshine and sea breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Welcome Dinner</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our amazing tour began with a private-kitchen dinner, hosted by two top Spanish chefs. As soon as we arrived at their house, we were ushered to their chic garden where we were greeted with cocktails. We then moved to their dining room, next to their open kitchen, where we enjoyed an eight-course modern Spanish dinner with a South American touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chefs wow-ed us as they prepared a variety of inventive dishes before our eyes – Jerusalem artichoke purée with orange reduction, an egg with truffle cooked at 64°C and a wonderful turbot with sweet chestnuts and mushrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After dinner, we transformed the dining room into a live music hall. A member showcased her piano skills by playing several all-time classics, which eventually evolved into a Spanish Cantata with the chefs and staff!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Cooking Classes</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To deepen our understanding of Spanish cuisine during our stay, we also attended a three-day cooking class, where we learned about Traditional Spanish Cooking, Molecular Cooking and Dessert Making under the guidance of Chef Fatima Gismero and Chef Alfonso Tomassoni. At the end of the course, we were all awarded certificates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Michelin Night</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight of this trip was our dinner at an impeccable contemporary-style restaurant that has earned two Michelin stars since it was founded in January 2006. It is led by Chef Martin Berasategui, who holds more Michelin stars than any other Spanish chef (ie, 7 stars). The aromas and flavours of every dish were an infusion of his gastronomic vision on Basque cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eight-course tasting menu was tailor-made for us. One of the more interesting plates we received soon after being seated was one containing five different kinds of butter (beetroot, mushroom, spinach, tomato and regular butter) that spanned the colours of the rainbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with all of the inventive cuisine we tried, this fantastic dinner would not have been the same without cava! With glasses of the bubbling drink on the house, we certainly enjoyed the warm hospitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Flamenco Class</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought our trip would be incomplete without Spanish Flamenco dancing, so we attended an hour-long beginner’s class at the beachfront Civic Centre of Barceloneta. Even though we may not have perfected the dance itself, our effort sure counts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who are interested to know more about our Gourmet Trip.

/>\n	2015年8月14日</p>\n<p>\n	本案原告人(下稱P)向第三被告人(下稱D3)提出申索，理由為D3交付貨物時出錯，構成挪佔貨物。2011年7月8日，P提出附帶條款和解提議，表示願意接受850,000美元(未計利息)以和解上述申索(下稱「涉案提議」)。法庭裁定D3勝訴。然而，上訴法庭裁定P上訴得直，並下令D3向P支付﹕(一)損害賠償852,399美元連帶利息，利率為商業息率(最優惠利率加一厘)，自錯誤交付貨物之日起計﹔及(二)原審和上訴的訟費。P現申請更改上述命令，根據《高等法院規則》 (第4章，附屬法例A)(下稱「《規則》」)第22號命令第24(2)及(3)條規則，要求法庭判給P﹕(一)P於2011年8月6日(即D3本可無需法庭許可而接受涉案提議的最後日期)或之後招致的按彌償基準計算的原審和上訴訟費﹔及(二)損害賠償額的利息，利率為最優惠利率加六厘，以及於2011年8月6日或之後招致的訟費的利息，利率為5.5%(最優惠利率加六厘的一半)。</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>裁決</strong> &mdash; 批准延展時限，但駁回上訴﹕</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		根據《規則》第22號命令第24(2)及(3)條規則而下令D3支付P於2011年8月6日或之後招致的按彌償基準計算的原審訟費，並非不公正。P大可真誠地認為其申索勝算極高。雖然P所提出的和解金額只略為低於申索額(兩者只相差0.27%)，但這本身不足以令到涉案提議「純屬訴訟策略」或「有欠真誠」，從而令作出P所尋求的命令變得不公正。即使附帶條款和解提議所提出的和解金額與申索額所差無幾，收到該提議的與訟方也應認真考慮該提議、提出切實的附帶條款和解反提議，以及促使雙方認真和切實地考慮進行敵對式訴訟以外的各種和解方案。</li>\n	<li>\n		至於上訴的訟費，即使有可能在上訴期間提出附帶條款和解提議，本案與訟雙方都沒有重新提出附帶條款和解提議，因此並不產生根據《規則》第22號命令第24(3)條規則而下令支付按彌償基準計算的訟費或額外訟費利息的問題。故此，涉案提議只會被視為可能影響本庭如何就上訴訟費行使酌情權的相關因素。D3不接納涉案提議，不能說是不合理。D3承受進行原審所帶來的敗訴風險，且獲判勝訴，但最終經P提出上訴而被判敗訴。因此，適當的做法是不干預關乎上訴訟費的暫准令，並在有需要時按對訟當事人基準評定訟費。</li>\n	<li>\n		雖然P是一家銀行，但這本身不能令下述命令變得不公正，即根據《規則》第22號命令第24(4)條規則下令D3支付P的訟費，而所有訟費的利息息率為最優惠利率加四厘的一半(這有助避免就每個項目所招致的訟費而計算利息)，以及下令D3就P獲判給的損害賠償支付按上述經提高息率計算的利息。</li>\n</ul>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:133:\"訟費

/>\n	2015年8月14日</p>\n<p>\n	本案原告人(下稱P)向第三被告人(下稱D3)提出申索，理由為D3交付貨物時出錯，構成挪佔貨物。2011年7月8日，P提出附帶條款和解提議，表示願意接受850,000美元(未計利息)以和解上述申索(下稱「涉案提議」)。法庭裁定D3勝訴。然而，上訴法庭裁定P上訴得直，並下令D3向P支付﹕(一)損害賠償852,399美元連帶利息，利率為商業息率(最優惠利率加一厘)，自錯誤交付貨物之日起計﹔及(二)原審和上訴的訟費。P現申請更改上述命令，根據《高等法院規則》 (第4章，附屬法例A)(下稱「《規則》」)第22號命令第24(2)及(3)條規則，要求法庭判給P﹕(一)P於2011年8月6日(即D3本可無需法庭許可而接受涉案提議的最後日期)或之後招致的按彌償基準計算的原審和上訴訟費﹔及(二)損害賠償額的利息，利率為最優惠利率加六厘，以及於2011年8月6日或之後招致的訟費的利息，利率為5.5%(最優惠利率加六厘的一半)。</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>裁決</strong> — 批准延展時限，但駁回上訴﹕</p>\n<ul><li>\n		根據《規則》第22號命令第24(2)及(3)條規則而下令D3支付P於2011年8月6日或之後招致的按彌償基準計算的原審訟費，並非不公正。P大可真誠地認為其申索勝算極高。雖然P所提出的和解金額只略為低於申索額(兩者只相差0.27%)，但這本身不足以令到涉案提議「純屬訴訟策略」或「有欠真誠」，從而令作出P所尋求的命令變得不公正。即使附帶條款和解提議所提出的和解金額與申索額所差無幾，收到該提議的與訟方也應認真考慮該提議、提出切實的附帶條款和解反提議，以及促使雙方認真和切實地考慮進行敵對式訴訟以外的各種和解方案。</li>\n<li>\n		至於上訴的訟費，即使有可能在上訴期間提出附帶條款和解提議，本案與訟雙方都沒有重新提出附帶條款和解提議，因此並不產生根據《規則》第22號命令第24(3)條規則而下令支付按彌償基準計算的訟費或額外訟費利息的問題。故此，涉案提議只會被視為可能影響本庭如何就上訴訟費行使酌情權的相關因素。D3不接納涉案提議，不能說是不合理。D3承受進行原審所帶來的敗訴風險，且獲判勝訴，但最終經P提出上訴而被判敗訴。因此，適當的做法是不干預關乎上訴訟費的暫准令，並在有需要時按對訟當事人基準評定訟費。</li>\n<li>\n		雖然P是一家銀行，但這本身不能令下述命令變得不公正，即根據《規則》第22號命令第24(4)條規則下令D3支付P的訟費，而所有訟費的利息息率為最優惠利率加四厘的一半(這有助避免就每個項目所招致的訟費而計算利息)，以及下令D3就P獲判給的損害賠償支付按上述經提高息率計算的利息。</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:141:\"<p>訟費

of proceedings – notice of discontinuance by plaintiff against those defendants invalid – leave to discontinue required</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>P commenced proceedings in 2009 by way of originating summons under O.88 r. 1 of the Rules of the High Court (Cap. 4A, Sub. Leg.) (the “RHC”), but did not file any affidavit evidence pursuant to O. 28 r. 1A(4). Only D1 filed an acknowledgment of service; and in May 2011, by consent between P and D1 (with D2–3 being absent), the proceedings were ordered to be continued as if the same had been begun by writ and directions were given for the filing of pleadings. D1 filed his defence and counterclaim in July 2011. Default judgment was initially obtained against D2–3 in August 2011, but was set aside in July 2013 on the ground that service on D2–3 was irregular and that they had a meritorious defence. P then served a notice of discontinuance (the “Notice”) on D2–3. Notwithstanding, D2–3 filed a defence and counterclaim in August 2013. D2–3, who wished to have their counterclaim tried in these proceedings, contended that the Notice was invalid as P could not discontinue the proceedings against them without leave. The Master held that the Notice was effective and expunged D2–3’s defence and counterclaim. D2–3 appealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, allowing the appeal, that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The statutory code of discontinuance was enacted to fetter the otherwise unqualified option of a plaintiff in a common law action to discontinue the action at any time and leave it to the court to decide whether a plaintiff could still discontinue after his action had reached a certain stage, and if so, whether he should be allowed to do so only on terms.</li>\r\n	<li>Order 21 rr. 2(1) and (3) of the RHC did not apply to originating summons proceedings that were ordered to continue as if begun by writ. The right to discontinue without leave could be exercised only within a very narrow window from commencement of proceedings. In relation to such proceedings, O. 21 rr. 2(3A), (3B) and 3 drew the line at the service of affidavit evidence by the defendant. It would be inconsistent with the legislative intention underlying the leave requirement if a plaintiff, not having discontinued the proceedings under O. 21 r. 2(3A) within 14 days after being served with the defendant’s affidavit evidence, were given another option to discontinue without leave through the application of O. 21 r. 2(1) and (3) to proceedings directed to continue as if begun by writ under O. 28 r. 8. It did not matter that neither party served affidavit evidence pursuant to O. 28 as happened here.</li>\r\n	<li>It was doubtful whether the time limit under O. 21 r.2(1) and (3) could be “reset” by the timetable laid down by the Court for D2–3 to serve their defences after setting aside the default judgment. This was particularly so when the default judgment was set aside also on merits. It would be inconsistent with the principle underlying the requirement for leave to discontinue if P could, after opposing D2–3’s application to set aside the default judgment, discontinue without leave under O. 21 r. 2(1) or (3).

a religious charitable trust and an incorporated company. X was divided into two rival camps: the Traditionalists&rsquo; Camp, including Ds, on one side and the Reformists&rsquo; Camp, including Ps, on the other. On 15 October 2011, without giving prior notification of a proposal to expel Ps, the charges against them or an opportunity to present their respective cases, the Board passed a resolution terminating their membership of X (the &ldquo;Termination Resolution&rdquo;) for breach of charitable objects in art.3 of the memorandum of association (the &ldquo;Memorandum&rdquo;) and breach of the religious oath. On 11 November 2011, notices of the decision were issued to Ps, who brought proceedings against 15 councillors of the Board and X challenging the validity of the Termination Resolution, which was one of three actions between the parties. Article 9.2 of X&rsquo;s articles of association stipulated that a member could be expelled only if the councillors were satisfied that a member had failed or refused to abide by any of the articles and/or rules or regulations made under art. 8.1; and he had a right to appeal against the decision.

Further, various factors, including that certain members of the Reformist Camp had donated substantial sums to X, suggested that Ps had substantial interests in its operation and future development. Accordingly, the Termination Resolution was unlawful.</li>\n	<li>\n		An expelled member should be notified of disciplinary proceedings and charges against him. It was no answer that, given the circumstances leading to the dispute, the member should have known about such charges. Although an appeal procedure was provided for by the Articles, there would not have been a fair result reached by fair methods. The Traditionalists&rsquo; Camp wished to crush the opposition once and for all. Even if Ps had appealed, the board hearing it would not be a properly constituted one, much less a fair and impartial tribunal because the two other members of the appeal committee were not selected by the honorary legal adviser in accordance with art. 9.2, but by the Board. Moreover, under art. 17, the Termination Resolution stripped Ps&rsquo; of their right to stand for election as councillors even if they appealed against the decision and so natural justice demanded that they be given the right to be heard before it was passed.</li>\n</ul>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:217:\"Religious institution incorporated as company – expulsion of members – whether rules of natural justice applied in terminating membership of religious charitable trust and incorporated company limited by guarantee\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:3666:\"<p>Religious institution incorporated as company – expulsion of members – whether rules of natural justice applied in terminating membership of religious charitable trust and incorporated company limited by guarantee\n</p><p>\n	Tong Cun Ming v Cheung Sun Ling Sanny</p>\n<p>\n	<a href=\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&amp;src=rl&amp;srguid=i0ad62903000001519fb116b22ae09b0f&amp;docguid=I42ED3241FEF14FE298FEF0967AF82747&amp;hitguid=I42ED3241FEF14FE298FEF0967AF82747&amp;spos=1&amp;epos=1&amp;td=1&amp;crumb-action=append&amp;context=10\">[2015] HKEC 1834</a><br />\n	Court of First Instance<br />\n	Miscellaneous Proceedings Nos. 143, 1013 &amp; 2477 of 2011<br />\n	David Lok J<br />\n	2 September 2015</p>\n<p>\n	X was a religious institution, a religious charitable trust and an incorporated company.

Moreover, under art. 17, the Termination Resolution stripped Ps’ of their right to stand for election as councillors even if they appealed against the decision and so natural justice demanded that they be given the right to be heard before it was passed.</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:225:\"<p>Religious institution incorporated as company – expulsion of members – whether rules of natural justice applied in terminating membership of religious charitable trust and incorporated company limited by guarantee</p>\n\";}}}s:11:\"field_court\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:23:\"Court of First Instance\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:23:\"Court of First Instance\";}}}s:14:\"field_featured\";a:0:{}s:11:\"title_field\";a:1:{s:2:\"en\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:37:\"Tong Cun Ming v Cheung Sun Ling Sanny\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:37:\"Tong Cun Ming v Cheung Sun Ling Sanny\";}}}s:14:\"field_contents\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"474\";}}}s:20:\"field_practice_areas\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:2:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"100\";}i:1;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"103\";}}}s:13:\"field_authors\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:3:\"tid\";s:3:\"612\";}}}s:19:\"field_journal_issue\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:4:{s:5:\"value\";s:19:\"2015-12-01 08:00:00\";s:8:\"timezone\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:11:\"timezone_db\";s:14:\"Asia/Hong_Kong\";s:9:\"date_type\";s:8:\"datetime\";}}}s:18:\"field_citation_url\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:232:\"http://login.westlaw.com.hk/maf/wlhk/app/document?&src=rl&srguid=i0ad62903000001519fb116b22ae09b0f&docguid=I42ED3241FEF14FE298FEF0967AF82747&hitguid=I42ED3241FEF14FE298FEF0967AF82747&spos=1&epos=1&td=1&crumb-action=append&context=10\";s:5:\"title\";s:16:\"[2015] HKEC 1834\";s:10:\"attributes\";a:0:{}}}}s:15:\"field_case_date\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:16:\"2 September 2015\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:16:\"2 September 2015\";}}}s:18:\"field_case_subject\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:5:\"value\";s:11:\"Company Law\";s:6:\"format\";N;s:10:\"safe_value\";s:11:\"Company Law\";}}}s:19:\"field_jurisdictions\";a:0:{}s:18:\"field_court_number\";a:0:{}s:12:\"field_judges\";a:0:{}s:14:\"title_original\";s:37:\"Tong Cun Ming v Cheung Sun Ling Sanny\";s:11:\"rdf_mapping\";a:9:{s:7:\"rdftype\";a:2:{i:0;s:9:\"sioc:Item\";i:1;s:13:\"foaf:Document\";}s:5:\"title\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"dc:title\";}}s:7:\"created\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"dc:date\";i:1;s:10:\"dc:created\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:7:\"changed\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:11:\"dc:modified\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:15:\"content:encoded\";}}s:3:\"uid\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:has_creator\";}s:4:\"type\";s:3:\"rel\";}s:4:\"name\";a:1:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:9:\"foaf:name\";}}s:13:\"comment_count\";a:2:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:16:\"sioc:num_replies\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:11:\"xsd:integer\";}s:13:\"last_activity\";a:3:{s:10:\"predicates\";a:1:{i:0;s:23:\"sioc:last_activity_date\";}s:8:\"datatype\";s:12:\"xsd:dateTime\";s:8:\"callback\";s:12:\"date_iso8601\";}}s:3:\"cid\";i:0;s:22:\"last_comment_timestamp\";s:10:\"1449446400\";s:17:\"last_comment_name\";s:0:\"\";s:16:\"last_comment_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:13:\"comment_count\";i:0;s:4:\"name\";s:5:\"admin\";s:7:\"picture\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"data\";s:241:\"a:7:{s:5:\"block\";a:1:{s:6:\"system\";a:1:{s:4:\"main\";i:0;}}s:16:\"ckeditor_default\";s:1:\"t\";s:20:\"ckeditor_show_toggle\";s:1:\"t\";s:14:\"ckeditor_width\";s:4:\"100%\";s:13:\"ckeditor_lang\";s:2:\"en\";s:18:\"ckeditor_auto_lang\";s:1:\"t\";s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;}\";}',0,1458115031,1),('9311','O:8:\"stdClass\":41:{s:3:\"vid\";s:4:\"9315\";s:3:\"uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:5:\"title\";s:37:\"Secretary for Justice v Cheng Kam Mun\";s:3:\"log\";s:29:\"Created by FeedsNodeProcessor\";s:6:\"status\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"comment\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"promote\";s:1:\"0\";s:6:\"sticky\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"nid\";s:4:\"9311\";s:4:\"type\";s:12:\"case_updates\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"created\";s:10:\"1449446400\";s:7:\"changed\";s:10:\"1456675400\";s:4:\"tnid\";s:4:\"9311\";s:9:\"translate\";s:1:\"0\";s:18:\"revision_timestamp\";s:10:\"1455866109\";s:12:\"revision_uid\";s:1:\"1\";s:4:\"body\";a:1:{s:3:\"und\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:5:\"value\";s:2769:\"<p><em>Application for order of committal after leave to apply granted – failure to enter originating summons for hearing within 14 days under O. 52 r. 3(2) – court had no inherent jurisdiction to extend time for compliance with O. 52 r. 3(2) in criminal contempt case</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Secretary for Justice (the “SJ”) obtained leave to apply for an order of committal against Xs, in respect of conduct which allegedly constituted criminal contempt.

/>\r\n2015年9月1日</p>\r\n\r\n<p>律政司司長(下稱「司長」)獲批予許可，申請命令把被指曾作出構成刑事藐視法庭的行為的各名答辯人(下稱Xs)交付羈押。司長繼而發出原訴傳票，要求法庭以Xs刑事藐視法庭為由而下令把他們交付羈押。不過，司長未有於14天內登錄該原訴傳票以待聆訊，因此，根據《高等法院規則》(第4章，附屬法例A)(下稱「《規則》」)第52號命令第3(2)條規則，上述許可即告失效。司長於是根據《規則》第3號命令第5條規則，申請延展時限，讓司長可依照第52號命令第3(2)條規則，發出通知書預約時間聆訊該原訴傳票。在該申請的聆訊中，司長承認，由於交付羈押令的申請乃建基於刑事藐視法庭，故原訟法庭無權根據第3號命令第5條規則延展時限。然而，司長辯稱原訟法庭具有固有司法管轄權延展時限。司長亦提出交替辯據，指上訴法庭在<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案的裁決中表示第52號命令第3(2)條規則下「登錄原訴傳票以待聆訊」意指發出通知書預約時間聆訊該原訴傳票的部份乃屬判決中的錯誤評論，對原訟法庭沒有約束力。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>裁決</strong> — 駁回申請﹕</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>原訟法庭受<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案約束。原審法官不能倚賴「判決中的錯誤評論」法則，以拒絕依循與案件直接相關的上訴法庭裁決。推翻該裁決的方法，就只有把事情提呈上訴法庭(或終審法院)，又或尋求修訂 《規則》。</li>\r\n	<li>原訟法庭不具有固有司法管轄權把遵守第52號命令第3(2)條規則的時限延展。不遵守該規則的後果已毫不含糊地訂明為「許可即告失效」，這方面的立法意願亦清楚不過。固有司法管轄權不能延伸至包括訂立任何與明文法規互不一致的程序。就此而言，<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案與本案有別，因為該案涉及民事藐視法庭，而不受爭議的是法庭在該類案件中有權根據第3號命令第5(1)條規則延展時限。</li>\r\n	<li>此外，各項海外裁決雖然對原訟法庭沒有約束力，但支持以下說法，即第52號命令第3(2)條規則下的時限屬強制性，以及在涉及刑事藐視法庭的案件中，遵守該規則方面的缺失不能透過法庭延展時限來補救。</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:297:\"<p>在獲給予所需許可後，申請交付羈押令

/>\n2015年9月1日</p>\n<p>律政司司長(下稱「司長」)獲批予許可，申請命令把被指曾作出構成刑事藐視法庭的行為的各名答辯人(下稱Xs)交付羈押。司長繼而發出原訴傳票，要求法庭以Xs刑事藐視法庭為由而下令把他們交付羈押。不過，司長未有於14天內登錄該原訴傳票以待聆訊，因此，根據《高等法院規則》(第4章，附屬法例A)(下稱「《規則》」)第52號命令第3(2)條規則，上述許可即告失效。司長於是根據《規則》第3號命令第5條規則，申請延展時限，讓司長可依照第52號命令第3(2)條規則，發出通知書預約時間聆訊該原訴傳票。在該申請的聆訊中，司長承認，由於交付羈押令的申請乃建基於刑事藐視法庭，故原訟法庭無權根據第3號命令第5條規則延展時限。然而，司長辯稱原訟法庭具有固有司法管轄權延展時限。司長亦提出交替辯據，指上訴法庭在<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案的裁決中表示第52號命令第3(2)條規則下「登錄原訴傳票以待聆訊」意指發出通知書預約時間聆訊該原訴傳票的部份乃屬判決中的錯誤評論，對原訟法庭沒有約束力。</p>\n<p><strong>裁決</strong> — 駁回申請﹕</p>\n<ul><li>原訟法庭受<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案約束。原審法官不能倚賴「判決中的錯誤評論」法則，以拒絕依循與案件直接相關的上訴法庭裁決。推翻該裁決的方法，就只有把事情提呈上訴法庭(或終審法院)，又或尋求修訂 《規則》。</li>\n<li>原訟法庭不具有固有司法管轄權把遵守第52號命令第3(2)條規則的時限延展。不遵守該規則的後果已毫不含糊地訂明為「許可即告失效」，這方面的立法意願亦清楚不過。固有司法管轄權不能延伸至包括訂立任何與明文法規互不一致的程序。就此而言，<em>Effiscient Ltd v Lehman</em>一案與本案有別，因為該案涉及民事藐視法庭，而不受爭議的是法庭在該類案件中有權根據第3號命令第5(1)條規則延展時限。</li>\n<li>此外，各項海外裁決雖然對原訟法庭沒有約束力，但支持以下說法，即第52號命令第3(2)條規則下的時限屬強制性，以及在涉及刑事藐視法庭的案件中，遵守該規則方面的缺失不能透過法庭延展時限來補救。</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:296:\"<p>在獲給予所需許可後，申請交付羈押令

/>\n	2015年8月12日</p>\n<p>\n	本案被告人是西非幾內亞國民，承認一項「販運危險藥物」罪。案情指出，被告人乘搭航機從尼日利亞來港，到步後在香港機場被截查和羈押。羈押期間，被告人從體內排出82粒內含共重0.79公斤可卡因的丸狀物。他在警誡下承認曾在尼日利亞拉各斯市吞下該批丸狀物，並收取4,000美元作為把涉案毒品帶進香港的報酬。原審法官採納監禁20年半為量刑基準，基於跨國販毒元素而把刑期提高一年半，然後因應被告人認罪而把刑期扣減至14年8個月。事隔近四年後，被告人現申請許可逾期針對判刑提出上訴。對於為何延誤提出該申請，被告人解釋說其妻子(下稱W)最近被診斷患有乳癌，須接受手術，並希望被告人陪伴身旁，而W和被告人的年老雙親均無法照顧被告人和W的年幼女兒。被告人辯稱自己是其家庭的唯一經濟支柱，而其家庭已因他被判長期監禁而陷入財政困境。</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>裁決</strong> — 駁回申請﹕</p>\n<ul><li>\n		被告人的申請嚴重過期，且無理可據。與被告人的辯據相反，建基於跨國販毒元素的一年半刑期增幅，絕無超越可供原審法官考慮和採納的幅度。</li>\n<li>\n		即使本庭接納被告人妻子和家庭的狀況，這基本上也不構成涉及毒品的罪行的減刑因素。不論如何，純粹基於人道理由而給予的減刑不會對被告人有任何幫助，除非本庭有意讓他即時獲釋，但考慮到涉案罪行的嚴重性質，本庭根本不可能持該種想法。</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:128:\"<p>危險藥物

On 14 July 2012, X was using a highly pressurised gun to inject grease via a plastic hose into a lorry, when the hose suddenly burst and grease punctured his left hand. X was aged 59 at the time of the accident. He had received only primary school education and had worked for many years only as a garage mechanic. X’s work was physically demanding. He used hand tools and lifted/moved objects weighing over 100–200 lbs. Joint orthopaedic experts agreed that X had sustained an injection injury/grease gun injury to the left hand and the residual impairment was severe. He had lost his fine motor skills and strength in his left hand. X was not fit to return to his pre-accident job or any work requiring a strong handgrip and dexterity or medium to heavy manual labour. Suitable alternative occupations included a security guard, for which the average monthly salary was HK$9,117 in September 2012. One expert estimated the total loss of earning capacity at 21 percent, another at 10 percent. X’s pre-accident monthly earnings were HK$16,900. Based on X’s left hand injury resulting in left hand scar and left thumb interphalangeal joint and metacarpophalangeal joint stiffness, the Employees’ Compensation (Ordinary Assessment) Board (the “Board”), assessed a permanent loss of earning capacity (“PLEC”) of 12 percent, which was subsequently reassessed at 15percent. X appealed under s. 18 of the Employees’ Compensation Ordinance (Cap. 282) (the “ECO”), seeking an assessment under s. 9(1A) of the ECO of the percentage of compensation which would have been payable in case of permanent total incapacity as was proportionate to the loss of earning capacity permanently caused by the injury in any employment which, having regard to the special circumstances set out in s. 9(1A)(b), the employee was capable of undertaking at that time. P’s injury did not fall within the First Schedule to the ECO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, finding that D was liable to pay compensation to P under the ECO, allowing the appeal and assessing compensation for permanent partial incapacity under s. 9(1A), that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The nature of X’s injuries, his qualifications, previous training and experience constituted the “special circumstances” stipulated in s. 9(1A)(b) of the ECO.</li>\r\n	<li>A post-accident monthly salary as a security guard of HK$9,117 involved a 46percent actual reduction in earnings [(HK$16,900 – HK$9,117) ÷ HK$16,900 x 100%], which was significantly more than the 15 percent loss of earning capacity assessed by the Board. In the circumstances, the <em>Paper Mills</em> formula would be applied and the appeal allowed by substituting 15 percent with 46percent pursuant to s. 18(3) of the ECO. Under s. 7(1)(c) of the ECO, the compensation for permanent total incapacity resulting from the injury, in the case of an employee aged 56 or over at the time of the accident, was a lump sum equal to 48 months’ earnings or 48 times the amount specified in the second column of Sch. 6 opposite s.7(1)(c) in the first column, whichever was less. Thus here, the award under s. 9 was HK$373,584 [(HK$16,900 – HK$9,117) ÷ HK$16,900 x HK$811,200].</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:225:\"<p>Employees’ compensation – permanent partial incapacity – special circumstances of employee stipulated in s. 9(1A)(b) applied – compensation for permanent partial incapacity assessed under s. 9(1A) – quantum</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:3517:\"<p><em>Employees’ compensation – permanent partial incapacity – special circumstances of employee stipulated in s. 9(1A)(b) applied – compensation for permanent partial incapacity assessed under s. 9(1A) – quantum</em></p>\n<p>X was injured while working as an automobile mechanic for D who ran a repair garage.

P’s injury did not fall within the First Schedule to the ECO.</p>\n<p><strong>Held</strong>, finding that D was liable to pay compensation to P under the ECO, allowing the appeal and assessing compensation for permanent partial incapacity under s. 9(1A), that:</p>\n<ul><li>The nature of X’s injuries, his qualifications, previous training and experience constituted the “special circumstances” stipulated in s. 9(1A)(b) of the ECO.</li>\n<li>A post-accident monthly salary as a security guard of HK$9,117 involved a 46percent actual reduction in earnings [(HK$16,900 – HK$9,117) ÷ HK$16,900 x 100%], which was significantly more than the 15 percent loss of earning capacity assessed by the Board. In the circumstances, the <em>Paper Mills</em> formula would be applied and the appeal allowed by substituting 15 percent with 46percent pursuant to s. 18(3) of the ECO. Under s. 7(1)(c) of the ECO, the compensation for permanent total incapacity resulting from the injury, in the case of an employee aged 56 or over at the time of the accident, was a lump sum equal to 48 months’ earnings or 48 times the amount specified in the second column of Sch. 6 opposite s.7(1)(c) in the first column, whichever was less. Thus here, the award under s. 9 was HK$373,584 [(HK$16,900 – HK$9,117) ÷ HK$16,900 x HK$811,200].</li>\n</ul>\";s:12:\"safe_summary\";s:224:\"<p>Employees’ compensation – permanent partial incapacity

Injury – future loss of earnings – no proper evidential basis to support findings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 30 June 2007, P, an apprentice vehicle mechanic, sustained a crushed foot at work. P’s employer, Ds, was liable for the accident. P underwent a variety of treatments, including closed K-wire fixation of his fractured first three toes, physiotherapy, treatment from a pain specialist, as well as psychiatric and psychological treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). Following a joint examination of P in August 2009, the parties’ orthopaedic experts found he walked with a normal gait; no muscle wasting of the lower limbs; and the complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (“CRPS1”) had resolved. The Judge found that P had adopted a sick role as a consequence of his own personality and not the accident; and, given the experts’ evidence, P was fit to seek suitable alternative employment two months after the expiry of his sick leave on 7 April 2009 and so awarded only partial loss of earnings for the remaining pre-trial period. On the issue of future loss of earnings, the Judge found that P would suffer a future partial loss of earnings of HK$1,250 per month for only seven years, assessed by taking P’s median notional post-trial earnings as an experienced vehicle mechanic at HK$14,000 per month and deducting the median future earnings for suitable alternative employment at HK$12,750 per month during this period. The sum of HK$110,250 (HK$1,250 x 105 percent x 12 months x 7 years) for future partial loss of earnings and Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) benefits was then discounted to an award of HK$95,000 for accelerated receipt. P appealed against the awards for, among other things, future loss of earnings.

Accordingly, there was no proper evidential basis to support his findings that in seven years’ time, P’s post-trial earnings from alternative employment and the post-trial notional earnings as an experienced mechanic would both increase to HK$18,000 per month resulting in no further loss of earnings. A multiplier of 12 was appropriate given the likelihood that in time the gap between P’s earnings from alternative employment and the post-trial notional earnings as an experienced vehicle mechanic would narrow and close and, based on the partial monthly loss of future earnings of HK$1,250, the future loss of earnings and MPF benefits was HK$189,000 (HK$1,250 x 105 percent x 12 months x 12 years).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:103:\"<p>Personal Injury – future loss of earnings – no proper evidential basis to support findings</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:2785:\"<p>Personal Injury – future loss of earnings – no proper evidential basis to support findings</p>\n<p>On 30 June 2007, P, an apprentice vehicle mechanic, sustained a crushed foot at work.

July 2015, the Law Society Cookery, Food and Wine Appreciation Group took a fascinating gourmet trip to Barcelona, a city of sunshine and sea breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Welcome Dinner</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our amazing tour began with a private-kitchen dinner, hosted by two top Spanish chefs. As soon as we arrived at their house, we were ushered to their chic garden where we were greeted with cocktails. We then moved to their dining room, next to their open kitchen, where we enjoyed an eight-course modern Spanish dinner with a South American touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chefs wow-ed us as they prepared a variety of inventive dishes before our eyes – Jerusalem artichoke purée with orange reduction, an egg with truffle cooked at 64°C and a wonderful turbot with sweet chestnuts and mushrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After dinner, we transformed the dining room into a live music hall. A member showcased her piano skills by playing several all-time classics, which eventually evolved into a Spanish Cantata with the chefs and staff!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Cooking Classes</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To deepen our understanding of Spanish cuisine during our stay, we also attended a three-day cooking class, where we learned about Traditional Spanish Cooking, Molecular Cooking and Dessert Making under the guidance of Chef Fatima Gismero and Chef Alfonso Tomassoni. At the end of the course, we were all awarded certificates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Michelin Night</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight of this trip was our dinner at an impeccable contemporary-style restaurant that has earned two Michelin stars since it was founded in January 2006. It is led by Chef Martin Berasategui, who holds more Michelin stars than any other Spanish chef (ie, 7 stars). The aromas and flavours of every dish were an infusion of his gastronomic vision on Basque cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eight-course tasting menu was tailor-made for us. One of the more interesting plates we received soon after being seated was one containing five different kinds of butter (beetroot, mushroom, spinach, tomato and regular butter) that spanned the colours of the rainbow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with all of the inventive cuisine we tried, this fantastic dinner would not have been the same without cava! With glasses of the bubbling drink on the house, we certainly enjoyed the warm hospitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Flamenco Class</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought our trip would be incomplete without Spanish Flamenco dancing, so we attended an hour-long beginner’s class at the beachfront Civic Centre of Barceloneta. Even though we may not have perfected the dance itself, our effort sure counts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who are interested to know more about our Gourmet Trip. Please contact group convenor, Mr. Nick Chan (<a href=\"mailto:Nick.Chan@SquirePB.com\">Nick.Chan@SquirePB.com</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Looking forward</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the Cookery, Food and Wine Appreciation Group have already commenced with planning of our 2016 trip to Vietnam.

/>\n	<br />\n	In retrospect, 2015 will possibly be viewed as a year of transition for Chinese antitrust law. On the one hand, there appears to have been a change in pace in the enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law (&ldquo;AML&rdquo;). On the other hand, certain antitrust developments in 2015 reflect continuity with prior enforcement trends and policies. <br />\n	<br />\n	<em>Change in 2015</em><br />\n	<br />\n	In the Chinese antitrust field, 2015 started with the landmark Qualcomm decision. The decision is frequently viewed as one of the most, if not the most, controversial antitrust case in China in the past years. The National Development and Reform Commission (&ldquo;NDRC&rdquo;) imposed a record fine of around RMB 6 billion on Qualcomm for alleged abuse of dominance. To our knowledge, this fine is the second highest imposed on a single company in an individual case in the history of antitrust law &ndash; on a global basis.<br />\n	<br />\n	In the lead-up to the Qualcomm decision, there had been numerous complaints against a perceived bias in Chinese antitrust law enforcement, especially by foreign stakeholders (including the US government). Perhaps as a reaction to these complaints, the three Chinese antitrust authorities &ndash; NDRC, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (&ldquo;SAIC&rdquo;) and the Ministry of Commerce (&ldquo;MOFCOM&rdquo;) &ndash; took somewhat of a &quot;lower profile&quot; in 2015 after Qualcomm. <br />\n	<br />\n	In parallel with the lower intensity in enforcement activity, the antitrust authorities undertook wide-ranging normative efforts in 2015. NDRC was busy drafting AML implementation guidelines on the abuse of intellectual property rights (&ldquo;IPRs&rdquo;); leniency; commitments; exemption procedure; calculation of fines and illegal gains; and rules for the automobile sector. SAIC was preparing its own proposal for guidelines on AML enforcement in the IPR field. MOFCOM was drafting guidance on IPR aspects in merger control, and worked on updating its merger filing guidance. <br />\n	<br />\n	Beyond this general shift towards a &quot;lower profile&quot; enforcement approach, to an extent, there were other notable changes in 2015. For example, as some sort of departure from prior practice, more enforcement cases in 2015 targeted state-owned enterprises (&ldquo;SOEs&rdquo;) or challenged government-mandated anti-competitive conduct. <br />\n	<br />\n	As to SOEs, for instance NDRC&#39;s Yunnan branch investigated and sanctioned four state-owned telecommunications operators for suspected cartel conduct. SAIC&#39;s local office in Liaoning sanctioned a tobacco company with a statutory monopoly for abuse of dominance. MOFCOM fined a series of SOEs for failure to file reportable mergers. The courts also examined cases involving allegations of anti-competitive conduct by SOEs &ndash; for example, Sinopec&#39;s refusal to deal case in Yunnan, though the appeal judgment in 2015 turned to be in the company&#39;s favor.<br />\n	<br />\n	As to government-orchestrated anti-competitive conduct, NDRC was particularly active in 2015. The authority significantly stepped up enforcement against &quot;administrative monopolies,&quot; challenging anti-competitive actions by a variety of government bodies throughout China, such as the Shandong Department of Transportation, the Yunnan Communications Bureau, and a local Health and Family Planning Commission in Bengbu, Anhui Province.<br />\n	<br />\n	In merger control, several developments indicated change in 2015. For instance, the so-called &quot;simple case&quot; procedure &ndash; though launched by MOFCOM in 2014 &ndash; really took off in 2015, as the number of filings under the new procedure surged to above 250 (compared to around 80 in 2014). Another important change to streamline the merger review process was the internal restructuring of MOFCOM&#39;s Anti-Monopoly Bureau. In September 2015, MOFCOM decided to convert the Consultation Division into an additional case team division, together with the Legal Division and Economics Division. Today, all cases are allocated to one of the three divisions, and a single case team from one of the divisions is responsible for reviewing a case from submission to clearance. <br />\n	<br />\n	<em>Continuity in 2015</em><br />\n	<br />\n	While 2015 brought many changes, there were also clear indications of continuity with past enforcement and policies. For example, a clear link with pre-2015 enforcement was that high technology and IPRs continued to be targets of AML enforcement, though perhaps in a more subdued way. For example, enforcement against abusive licensing of standard essential patents (&ldquo;SEPs&rdquo;) continued throughout 2015: NDRC adopted the Qualcomm decision; SAIC issued the regulation on AML enforcement in the IPR field, which includes a specific SEP provision; and MOFCOM imposed SEP remedies in the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent case. <br />\n	<br />\n	For NDRC specifically, continuity with prior enforcement was visible in its actions in the automobile industry, and its handling of international cartel cases. In 2015, NDRC and its local offices continued antitrust campaigns against automobile manufacturers and dealers. For example, in April, NDRC&#39;s Jiangsu branch fined Mercedes-Benz and its dealers for engaging in anti-competitive agreements on resale prices (around RMB 350 and 7 million, respectively). <br />\n	<br />\n	Similarly, in December 2015, NDRC published a set of decisions sanctioning eight international shipping lines for alleged price fixing and market allocation, and imposed a fine of around RMB 407 million in total. These decisions reflect continuation of NDRC&#39;s enforcement against international cartels, starting with the LCD panels and Auto parts and bearings cases in 2013 and 2014.<br />\n	<br />\n	For its turn, SAIC&#39;s enforcement showed some continuity in 2015, for example in Liaoning Cigarettes, a tying case in the tobacco industry &ndash; in line with abuse of dominance cases against tobacco wholesalers brought by SAIC&#39;s provincial offices in Inner Mongolia and Jiangsu in 2014.<br />\n	<br />\n	<em>2015 Take Aways</em><br />\n	<br />\n	Overall, 2015 was a &quot;mixed bag&quot; of developments characterized by both change and continuity &ndash; with the authorities generally taking a &quot;lower profile&quot; in enforcement activities, but an increased focus on normative efforts.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>2016 Forecast</strong><br />\n	<br />\n	Going into 2016 and beyond, we would expect that &ndash; after finalising their normative projects &ndash; the officials at the Chinese antitrust authorities would go back full-steam to case handling. We would not be surprised if AML enforcement were to accelerate again soon.<br />\n	<br />\n	On the substantive front, some of the enforcement cases in 2015 &ndash; for example, the first refusal to deal decision by an administrative antitrust authority (in the Qingyang case, by SAIC&#39;s local branch in Chongqing) &ndash; and the guidelines on the IPR field and the automotive sectors may take Chinese antitrust law into new directions going forward. For instance, it may well be that the new guidelines for the automotive sector identify new types of illegal conduct (such as territorial restrictions imposed on distributors by non-dominant suppliers), and that such changes would expand to other sectors. <br />\n	&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:63:\"Adrian Emch, Partner, and Jiaming Zhang, Hogan Lovells, Beijing\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:7484:\"<p>Adrian Emch, Partner, and Jiaming Zhang, Hogan Lovells, Beijing\n</p><p>\n	To get an overview of the major anti-monopoly law developments in China in 2015 and a prediction of how the landscape might shift in 2016, Hong Kong Lawyer reached out to competition/antitrust law specialists, Adrian Emch, Partner, and Jiaming Zhang of Hogan Lovells’ Beijing office.</p>\n<p>	<strong>2015 Review</strong></p>\n<p>	In retrospect, 2015 will possibly be viewed as a year of transition for Chinese antitrust law.

Trading losses are important to consider, know and monitor. These lessons should be well understood from the Barings Bank scandal when hidden trading losses brought the bank to the point of insolvency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is important for firms to understand that there have been numerous cases in Hong Kong and elsewhere where traders have acted fraudulently under pressure to conceal their clients\' losses. One of the lessons is that if firms are unaware of the trading losses it reflects on the failure of senior management oversight and that internal controls are failing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCodes of conduct, with clear ethical principles, rules and regulations, do not in themselves guard against fraud. Firms can only rely on proper internal controls and management oversight, including spot checks, and monitoring systems to ensure that traders, who are under pressure, cannot bypass the system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe instances where internal controls and procedures within firms have failed because employees can bypass systems exposes weaknesses in the overall compliance structure and as in this case, many issues are only brought to attention because of clients complaints about Chow\'s handling of their accounts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Final Word</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese cases should make firms consider if there is a need to review their systems and controls and assess whether they can be bypassed in any way that would give rise to serious fraud. It also may be appropriate to conduct training sessions for employees and stressing if they make mistakes, or they are under pressure to conceal trading losses, emphasise the need for traders to \"put their hands up\" and encourage staff to report any problems and pressures they face.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the long run this is a cheaper approach than having the SFC and police investigate traders and the firm, not to mention the time lost and the reputational damage involved.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\";s:7:\"summary\";s:46:\"<p>Niall Coburn, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\r\n\";s:6:\"format\";s:9:\"full_html\";s:10:\"safe_value\";s:6158:\"<p>Niall Coburn, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\n<p>The lifetime ban imposed on a Hong Kong stockbroker has highlighted the need for firms to review their internal controls for the transfer of money from clients\' accounts without their written authority.

Wolf, Regulatory Intelligence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations Security Council resolutions and related sanctions are a key tool in cutting off money for the Islamic State, but member states must work to ensure that blacklisted parties are cut off from the global financial system, an international anti-terrorist financing body determined during a special meeting on Sunday, 14 February.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Participants considered steps that should be taken to enhance implementation of key provisions in those resolutions, as well as additional steps to protect the international financial system from abuse by ISIL (Islamic State),\" the global anti-money laundering standard-setting Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) said in a press statement released Wednesday, 17 February.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecurity Council Resolutions 2199 and 2253 said that trade in oil and other resources with ISIL is prohibited and authorized new efforts by the ISIL and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee to address the threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParticipants agreed \"meaningful progress\" had been made in degrading ISIL\'s financial strength. They discussed the group\'s financial links to foreign branches and a need to better engage countries where those affiliates operate, FATF said. They also addressed the need for more coordination to combat foreign terrorist fighter financing, including better information sharing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSunday\'s meeting took place in Paris and included delegates from FATF and the so-called Coalition Counter ISIL Finance Group (“CIFG”), a coalition of dozens of countries and organizations led by Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
